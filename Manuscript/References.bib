abstract = {Species roles in ecological networks combine to generate their architecture, which contributes to their stability. Species trait diversity also affects ecosystem functioning and resilience, yet it remains unknown whether species' contributions to functional diversity relate to their network roles. Here, we use 21 empirical pollen transport networks to characterise this relationship. We found that, apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners. Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially because key aspects of their flowering traits are conserved at a family level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight into mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {We compared species richness and abundance of birds between five patches under selective Alnus exploitation and five patches that have not been harvested for at least 10 years prior to our study, during the early dry season (April-July 2001), in Cotapata National Park. Using "point counts" we recorded birds and their distribution in two ({\textless}1.5 m and {\textgreater}1.5 m) forest layers. Simultaneously we evaluated the floristic structure (size [dbh] distribution, basal area, tree density, tree height, and vegetation cover) and composition (diversity) on three transects placed within each Alnus patch. Both bird diversity and vegetation cover were significantly higher in not presently used patches but only for the higher layer of the forest, whereas plant diversity was higher in presently used patches. Lack of differences between the two types of Alnus patches in any of the vegetation parameters measured in the lower layer was coupled with an indistinct avifauna. Small changes in habitat characteristics following a perturbation like selective logging have the potential to affect richness and abundance of birds, at least within the habitats directly affected by the perturbation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urbanization alters ecosystems worldwide, but little is known about its effects in the Neotropical region. In the present research we examined the relative influence of different levels of urbanization and of some urban development measures on bird species richness, abundance and composition. We surveyed 104 observation stations at which we collected data on the relative abundance of bird species, and also data on seven environmental variables as measures of urban development and human activity. We registered 57 native bird species. Bird species richness and bird abundance increased with lower urbanization levels. Both variables were positively related to vegetation cover and native vegetation, and negatively to built-up cover, abundance of Rock Pigeon (Columa livia), pedestrian rate and car rate. A canonical correspondence analysis produced a significant model that explained 37{\%} of the total variation in species data. This analysis segregated bird species along two important gradients: urbanization and elevation. The most urbanized areas were dominated by a few synanthropic species tolerant to human disturbance, such as Rufous-Collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata) or Chiguanco Thrush (Turdus chiguanco). Areas with lower urbanization levels had more species typically associated with native vegetation, such as Plain-Mantled Tit-Spinetail (Leptasthenura aegitaloides)orD'Orbigny's Chat-Tyrant (Ochthoeca oenanthoides), among others. Elevation had a significant influence in structuring bird communities, with some species restricted to higher elevations and some to lower elevations. Although changes in elevation had an important influence, urbanization had a stronger effect on structuring bird communities. This study provides valuable information and an important baseline for future studies.},

abstract = {Agricultural transformation represents one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, causing degradation and loss of habitat, leading to changes in the richness and composition of communities. These changes in richness and composition may, in turn, lead to altered species co-occurrence, but our knowledge of this remains limited. We used a novel co-occurrence network approach to examine the impact of agricultural transformation on reptile community structure within two large ({\textgreater} 172 000 km2; 224 sites) agricultural regions in southeastern Australia. We contrasted assemblages from sites surrounded by intact and modified landscapes and tested four key hypotheses that agricultural transformation leads to (H1) declines in species richness, (H2) altered assemblages, (H3) declines in overall co-occurrence, and (H4) complex restructuring of pairwise associations. We found that modified landscapes differed in composition but not richness compared with intact sites. Modified landscapes were also characterized by differences in co-occurrence network structure; with species sharing fewer sites with each other (reduced co-occurrence connectance), fewer highly-connected species (truncation of the frequency distribution of co-occurrence degree) and increased modularity of co-occurrence networks. Critically, overall loss of co-occurrence was underpinned by complex changes to the number and distribution of pair-wise co-occurrence links, with 41–44{\%} of species also gaining associations with other species. Change in co-occurrence was not correlated with changes in occupancy, nor by functional trait membership, allowing a novel classification of species susceptibility to agricultural transformation. Our study reveals the value of using co-occurrence analysis to uncover impacts of agricultural transformation that may be masked in conventional studies of species richness and community composition.},

We argue that the individual values of a similarity index are not useful as such: rather, we have to be able to estimate the statistical significance of the index value. Secondly, we argue that before computing the correlations one has to carefully select what is the underlying base set of locations for which the co-occurrence counts, similarity indices, and their significance is computed. We demonstrate base set selection with synthetic examples and conclude with an analysis of real data from a large database of fossil land mammals.},

abstract = {Aim  To test for non-random co-occurrence in 36 species of grassland birds using a new metric and the C-score. The analysis used presence–absence data of birds distributed among 305 sites (or landscapes) over a period of 35 years. This analysis departs from traditional analyses of species co-occurrence in its use of temporal data and of individual species' probabilities of occurrence to derive analytically the expected co-occurrence between paired species. Location  Great Plains region, USA. Methods  Presence–absence data for the bird species were obtained from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The analysis was restricted to species pairs whose geographic ranges overlapped. Each of 541 species pairs was classified as a positive, negative, or non-significant association depending on the mean difference between the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence over the 35-year time-span. Results  Of the 541 species pairs that were examined, 202 to 293 (37–54{\%}) were positively associated, depending on which of two null models was used. However, only a few species pairs ({\textless}5{\%}) were negatively associated. An additional 89 species pairs did not have overlapping ranges and hence represented de facto negative associations. The results from analyses based on C-scores generally agreed with the analyses based on the difference between observed and expected co-occurrence, although the latter analyses were slightly more powerful. Main conclusions  Grassland birds within the Great Plains region are primarily distributed among landscapes either independently or in conjunction with one another. Only a few species pairs exhibited repulsed or segregated distributions. This indicates that the shared preference for grassland habitat may be more important in producing coexistence than are negative species interactions in preventing it. The large number of non-significant associations may represent random associations and thereby indicate that the presence/absence of other grassland bird species may have little effect on whether a given focal species is also found within the landscape. In a broader context, the probability-based approach used in this study may be useful in future studies of species co-occurrence.},
annote = {Veech employs his probabilistic approach for the first time using BBS data in the great plains. He deliberately removes species pairs that do not overlap geographically, effectively removing on biogeographic segregations. His results reflect many more significant aggregations than segregations. However, a smaller analysis with theoretically competing sparrow species also turns up more aggregations showing that competition doesn't increase segregations even on a pretty good spatial resolution. He reports comparable results from a more mainstream co-occurrence approach and suggests the probabilistic method may be useful for other studies. 

This is in contrast to ETE analyses where biogeographic agg/seg make up a good chunk of significant associations. This may be why he has so many more aggs but not necessarily in light of the sparrow analysis. He uses temporal data but only averages over time instead of looking at change over time. May be useful to acquire this dataset and use it as a temporal network thing. He fails to check if clusters are formed despite the very dynamic nature of most individual links. This would be something I'd want to investigate with this data.},

abstract = {The Earth's ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure, yet the nature of contemporary biodiversity change is not well understood. Growing evidence that community size is regulated highlights the need for improved understanding of community dynamics. As stability in community size could be underpinned by marked temporal turnover, a key question is the extent to which changes in both biodiversity dimensions (temporal $\alpha$- and temporal $\beta$-diversity) covary within and among the assemblages that comprise natural communities. Here, we draw on a multiassemblage dataset (encompassing vertebrates, invertebrates, and unicellular plants) from a tropical freshwater ecosystem and employ a cyclic shift randomization to assess whether any directional change in temporal $\alpha$-diversity and temporal $\beta$-diversity exceeds baseline levels. In the majority of cases, $\alpha$-diversity remains stable over the 5-y time frame of our analysis, with little evidence for systematic change at the community level. In contrast, temporal $\beta$-diversity changes are more prevalent, and the two diversity dimensions are decoupled at both the within- and among-assemblage level. Consequently, a pressing research challenge is to establish how turnover supports regulation and when elevated temporal $\beta$-diversity jeopardizes community integrity.},

These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks.

abstract = {Species distribution in a metacommunity varies according to their traits, the distribution of environmental conditions and connectivity among localities. These ingredients contribute to coexistence across spatial scales via species sorting, patch dynamics, mass effects and neutral dynamics. These mechanisms however seldom act in isolation and the impact of landscape configuration on their relative importance remains poorly understood. We present a new model of metacommunity dynamics that simultaneously considers these four possible mechanisms over spatially explicit landscapes and propose a statistical approach to partition their contribution to species distribution. We find that landscape configuration can induce dispersal limitations that have negative consequences for local species richness. This result was more pronounced with neutral dynamics and mass effect than with species sorting or patch dynamics. We also find that the relative importance of the four mechanisms varies not only among landscape configurations, but also among species, with some species being mostly constrained by dispersal and/or drift and others by sorting. Changes in landscape properties might lead to a shift in coexistence mechanisms and, by extension, to a change in community composition. This confirms the importance of considering landscape properties for conservation and management. Our results illustrate the idea that ecological communities are the results of multiple mechanisms acting at the same time and complete our understanding of spatial processes in competitive metacommunities.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Recent studies connecting the decline of large predators and consumers with the disintegration of ecosystems often over- look that this natural experiment already occurred. As recently as 14 ka, tens of millions of large-bodied mammals were widespread across the American continents. Within 1000 yr of the arrival of humans, ∼ 80{\%} were extinct including all ? 600 kg. While the cause of the late Pleistocene (LP) extinction remains contentious, largely overlooked are the eco- logical consequences of the loss of millions of large-bodied animals. Here, we examine the influence of the LP extinction on a local mammal community. Our study site is Hall's Cave in the Great Plains of Texas, which has unparalleled fine-grained temporal resolution over the past 20 ka, allowing characterization of the community before and after the extinction. In step with continental patterns, this community lost 80{\%} of large-bodied herbivores and 20{\%} of apex predators at the LP extinction. Using tightly constrained temporal windows spanning full glacial to modern time periods and comprehensive faunal lists, we reconstruct mammal associations and body size distributions over time. We find changes in alpha and beta diversity, and in the statistical moments associated with periods of climate change as well as with the LP extinction event. Additionally, there is a fundamental change in the composition of herbivores, with grazers being replaced by frugivores/ granivores starting about 15 ka; the only large-bodied grazer remaining today is the bison Bison bison. Moreover, the null model program PAIRS reveals interesting temporal patterns in the disassociation or co-occurrence of species through the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene. Extinct species formed more significant associations than modern ones, and formed more aggregated pairs than do modern species. Further, negative species associations were about three times stronger than positive ones, suggesting that competitive interactions or environmental filtering are a strong force in community structure.},

abstract = {Viable populations of species occur in a given place if three conditions are met: the environment at the place is suitable; the species is able to colonize it; co-occurrence is possible despite or because of interactions with other species. Studies investigating the effects of climate change on species have mainly focused on measuring changes in climate suitability. Complex interactions among species have rarely been explored in such studies. We extend network theory to the analysis of complex patterns of co-occurrence among species. The framework is used to explore the robustness of networks under climate change. With our data, we show that networks describing the geographic pattern of co-occurrence among species display properties shared by other complex networks, namely that most species are poorly connected to other species in the network and only a few are highly connected. In our example, species more exposed to climate change tended to be poorly connected to other species within the network, while species more connected tended to be less exposed. Such high connectance would make the co-occurrence networks more robust to climate change. The proposed framework illustrates how network analysis could be used, together with co-occurrence data, to help addressing the potential consequences of species interactions in studies of climate change and biodiversity. However, more research is needed to test for links between co-occurrence and network interactions.},
annote = {Method for valuing co-occurrences: use a distance metric and then weed out species with expected overlap. The expected overlap is based on the expected frequency of finding both species ({\#}Sites * Pa * Pb) and its variance. The weeding method seems to work quite well in general, but if you look at the numbers it ends up excluding pairs at different alpha levels depending on the situation. For example, if the probability distribution has a low variance (peaked), this method might include a pair whose observed overlap probability is 15{\%}, but in other situations exclude a pair whose observed overlap probability is less than 5{\%}.},

abstract = {The study of species co-occurrences has been central in community ecology since the foundation of the discipline. Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate hypotheses for differ-ent community assembly mechanisms, and to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association decreases with the num-ber of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species inter-actions from co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distri-butions models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.},

abstract = {We assessed the ecomorphological structure of a guild of rhinolophoid bats in a Malaysian rainforest first described by Heller and von Helversen (1989). These authors found that the distribution of echolocation call frequencies used by 12 syntopic species was more even than expected from allometric relationships or in randomly generated communities, and that the observed minimal ratio was greater than expected by chance alone. In this study we were able to expand their guild to 15 species, but in doing so it became apparent that call frequencies might be less evenly distributed across the total frequency range than previously proposed. We rep-licated Heller and von Helversen's (1989) analyses with the full 15-species complement but were unable to support their suggestion that rhinolophoid bats exhibit resource partitioning through differences in frequency bands. We adopted a multivariate approach and incorporated measures of body size and wing morphology into the analysis. We used phylogenetic autocorrelation to ensure that the species were statistically independent and principal component analysis to describe the morphological space occupied by the 15 species in the community and four additional species representing the extremes of phenotypic variation. We derived interspecific Euclidean distances and tested the mean values and SDs of these distances against those of 100 guilds of "synthetic" species created randomly within the principal component space. The guild of Rhinolophoidea was not distributed randomly in multivariate space. Instead we found evidence of morphological overdispersion of the most similar species, which suggests niche differentiation in response to competition. Less similar species were nearer in morphological space than expected, and we suggest this is a consequence of ecological constraints on parameter combinations. Despite this underdispersion, many of the more distant neighbours were evenly rather than randomly spaced or clumped in morphospace, suggesting that, given the environmental constraints on morphology, species in this guild do experience limits to their similarity. Finally, we tested the influence of the relative abundance of species on morphological displacement, and found no evidence that abundant, spatially correlated species reduce interspecific overlap in morphological space.},

abstract = {Aim: There is a debate as to whether biotic interactions exert a dominant role in governing species distributions at macroecological scales. The prevailing idea is that climate is the key limiting factor; thus models that use present-day climate–species range relationships are expected to provide reasonable means to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions. However, there is little empirical evidence that biotic interactions would not constrain species distributions at macroecological scales. We examine this idea, for the first time, and provide tests for two null hypotheses: ( H 0 1) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in explaining current distributions of a particular species of butterfly (clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne ) in Europe; and ( H 0 2) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in predictions of altered species' ranges under climate change. Location: Europe. Methods: Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was used to investigate relationships between species and climate; species and host plants; and species and climate + host plants. Because models are sensitive to the variable selection strategies utilised, four alternative approaches were used: AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), BRUTO (Adaptive Backfitting), and CROSS (Cross Selection). Results: In spite of the variation in the variables selected with different methods, both hypotheses ( H 0 1 and H 0 2) were falsified, providing support for the proposition that biotic interactions significantly affect both the explanatory and predictive power of bioclimatic envelope models at macro scales. Main conclusions: Our results contradict the widely held view that the effects of biotic interactions on individual species distributions are not discernible at macroecological scales. Results are contingent on the species, type of interaction and methods considered, but they call for more stringent evidence in support of the idea that purely climate-based modelling would be sufficient to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions.},

abstract = {Understanding how ecological communities are organized and how they change through time is critical to predicting the effects of climate change. Recent work documenting the co-occurrence structure of modern communities found that most significant species pairs co-occur less frequently than would be expected by chance. However, little is known about how co-occurrence structure changes through time. Here we evaluate changes in plant and animal community organization over geological time by quantifying the co-occurrence structure of 359,896 unique taxon pairs in 80 assemblages spanning the past 300 million years. Co-occurrences of most taxon pairs were statistically random, but a significant fraction were spatially aggregated or segregated. Aggregated pairs dominated from the Carboniferous period (307 million years ago) to the early Holocene epoch (11,700 years before present), when there was a pronounced shift to more segregated pairs, a trend that continues in modern assemblages. The shift began during the Holocene and coincided with increasing human population size4,5 and the spread of agriculture in North America6,7. Before the shift, an average of 64{\%} of significant pairs were aggregated; after the shift, the average dropped to 37{\%}. The organization of modern and late Holocene plant and animal assemblages differs fundamentally from that of assemblages over the past 300 million years that predate the large-scale impacts of humans. Our results suggest that the rules governing the assembly of communities have recently been changed by human activity.},

Our hypotheses were (1) increasing species richness will have no effect on rates of cellulose decomposition and (2) species richness will decline over time in functionally redundant communities. A relatively simple microcosm‐based system to manipulate complex microbial interactions was employed. Microcosms containing cellulose as the sole carbon source were inoculated at equal densities with none, one, two, four, or eight species of cellulolytic bacteria. At 5‐d intervals for 25 d, community composition and cellulose decomposition were determined. We rejected both of our hypotheses. In a constant environment, greater species richness supported a greater number of individuals and subsequently greater rates of total cellulose decomposition. Furthermore, greater initial species richness maintained greater richness over time. These results provide experimental evidence that functionally redundant species may play an integral role in ecosystem function.},

@article{McKinney2006,
abstract = {When measured by extent and intensity, urbanization is one of the most homogenizing of all major human activities. Cities homogenize the physical environment because they are built to meet the relatively narrow needs of just one species, our own. Also, cities are maintained for centuries in a disequilibrium state from the local natural environment by the importation of vast resources of energy and materials. Consequently, as cities expand across the planet, biological homogenization increases because the same "urban-adaptable" species become increasingly widespread and locally abundant in cities across the planet. As urbanization often produces a local gradient of disturbance, one can also observe a gradient of homogenization. Synanthropic species adapted to intensely modified built habitats at the urban core are "global homogenizers", found in cities worldwide. However, many suburban and urban fringe habitats are occupied by native species that become regionally widespread. These suburban adapters typically consist of early successional plants and "edge" animal species such as mesopredator mammals, and ground-foraging, omnivorous and frugivorous birds that can utilize gardens, forest fragments and many other habitats available in the suburbs. A basic conservation challenge is that urban biota is often quite diverse and very abundant. The intentional and unintentional importation of species adapted to urban habitats, combined with many food resources imported for human use, often produces local species diversity and abundance that is often equal to or greater than the surrounding landscape. With the important exception of low-income areas, urban human populations often inhabit richly cultivated suburban habitats with a relatively high local floral and faunal diversity and/or abundance without awareness of the global impoverishment caused by urbanization. Equally challenging is that, because so many urban species are immigrants adapting to city habitats, urbanites of all income levels become increasingly disconnected from local indigenous species and their natural ecosystems. Urban conservation should therefore focus on promoting preservation and restoration of local indigenous species.},

abstract = {The nested subset hypothesis states that the species comprising a depauperate insular biota are a proper subset of those in richer biotas, and that an archipelago of such biotas, ranked by species richness, presents a nested series. The pattern characterizes the distributions of mammals in three different archipel- agos, and it appears more strongly developed among faunas in the process of relaxation (landbridge is- lands) than in those derived by overwater coloniza- tion (oceanic islands). The generality of the nested subset pattern and factors that may produce it are evaluated using distributions of land birds in the New Zealand region. Monte Carlo simulations show that species composition of these insular avifaunas is highly nonrandom, exhibiting significantly nested structure. However, avifaunas on nine oceanic islands lack the structure typical of all islands together or of the 22 landbridge islands. Thus, distinctive patterns of species composition, as well as species number, may distin- guish landbridge and oceanic islands. Because they are isolated fragments of once- continuous distributions, landbridge islands and their biotas have important implications for long-term bi- ological conservation in preserves. Real or virtual is- lands that have undergone faunal relaxation support only a fraction of the species expected in equivalent mainland areas. Furthermore, the species inhabiting fragments are not a random collection of those in the source pool, but are rather nested subsets of the species in richer, more intact biotas. The species preserved in such fragments tend to be the most abundant, generalist species that are least in need of special protection.},

@article{Terborgh1975,
abstract = {The object of our study was to compare the distributions of bird species common to two Andean localities in order to improve our understanding of the factors involved as primary causes in imposing distributional limits. A previous paper (Terborgh 1971) had evaluated the importance of three mechanisms in the avifauna of a control locality: (1) factors that vary continuously and in parallel with the elevational gradient, (2) competitive exclusion, and (3) ecotones. As was discussed in that paper, the method, when applied to a single tran- sect, leads to a systematic underestimation of the incidence of competition-mediated limits and to an overestimation of ecotone effects. By studying appropriately selected test localities, we could overcome many of these deficiencies and obtain results that are several steps closer to expressing reality. The control locality, the Cordillera Vilcabamba, is a sector of the Cordillera Oriental, or eastern chain of the main body of the Peruvian Andes. It carries what may be regarded as a complete avifauna, as the transect sliced through a continuous belt of forested terrain which, at any elevation, is exposed to invasion by appropriately adapted species from above and below as well as laterally. It differs in this respect from the test locality (Cerros del Sira), which is an isolated massif that rises out of the Amazonian plain some 100 km east of the main Andes. Because of this isolation, the upper portions of the Sira are exposed to invasion principally from below. An estimated 80{\%}-82{\%} of the species that would have occupied the summit zone of the Sira, had it been a portion of the main body of the Andes, were missing. Such a species deficit provides an ideal test of the efficacy of competition in limiting distributions, because it invites whatever species are available as colonists (in this case, those lower on the mountain) to invade until the community is effectively filled. Of the species that had the opportunity to expand their elevational ranges in the absence of high-elevation congeners that apparently excluded them on the control transect, a minimum of 71{\%} did so, confirming the original assignments of these as competition-limited species in the control locality. In addition, a majority (58{\%}) of the species that had no high-elevation congener on the control transect (assigned to the gradient mechanism), and that had the opportunity to expand into the species- deficit zone of the Sira, were found to do so. This reveals that diffuse competition (as dis- tinguished from the directly observable exclusion of congeners) was really the primary limiting mechanism for most of the species that had been assigned to the gradient mechanism in the control study. Instead of accounting for approximately a third of all distributional limits, as was concluded in the earlier report, it now appears that competition, both direct and diffuse, accounts for something more than two-thirds of the distributional limits of Andean birds whose ranges end somewhere between the lowland plain and tree line.

systematic loss of $\alpha$ diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through
time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change,
species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the
different patterns of temporal $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity. Monitoring and understanding change in species

abstract = {The potential for large-scale biodiversity losses as a result of climate change and human impact presents major challenges for ecology and conservation science. Governments around the world have established national parks and wildlife reserves to help protect biodiversity, but there are few studies on the long-term consequences of this strategy. We use Kenya as a case study to investigate species richness and other attributes of mammal communities in 6 protected areas over the past century. Museum records from African expeditions that comprehensively sampled mammals from these same areas in the early 1900's provide a baseline for evaluating changes in species richness and community structure over time. We compare species lists assembled from archived specimens (1896–1950) to those of corresponding modern protected areas (1950– 2013). Species richness in Kenya was stable or increased at 5 out of 6 sites from historical to modern times. Beta-diversity, in contrast, decreased across all sites. Potential biases such as variable historical vs. modern collection effort and detection of small-bodied, rare, and low-visibility species do not account for the observed results. We attribute the pattern of decreased beta diversity primarily to increased site occupancy by common species across all body size classes. Despite a decrease in land area available to wildlife, our data do not show the extinctions predicted by species-area relationships. Moreover, the results indicate that species-area curves based solely on protected areas could underestimate diversity because they do not account for mammal species whose ranges extend beyond protected area boundaries. We conclude that the 6 protected areas have been effective in preserving species richness in spite of continuing conversion of wild grasslands to cropland, but the overall decrease in beta diversity indicates a decline in the uniqueness of mammal communities that historically characterized Kenya's varied landscape.},

abstract = {The extent of spatial partitioning in insectivorous bats, whose prey is patchily distributed and transient in nature, remains a contentious issue. The recent separation of a common Palaearctic bat, the pipistrelle, into Pipis-trellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, which are morphologically similar and sympatric, provides an opportunity to examine this question. The present study used radio telemetry to address the spatial distribution and foraging characteristics of P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus in northeast Scotland, to test the hypothesis that coexistence between these species is facilitated through spatial segregation. We reveal large and significant differences in the spatial distribution and foraging characteristics of these two cryptic species. Individual P. pipistrellus home ranges were on average three times as large as that of P. pygmaeus, and they foraged for approximately an hour longer each night. Inter-specific spatial overlap was minimal ({\textless}5{\%}) and core foraging areas of either species were essentially mutually exclusive despite the proximity of the two roosts. Inter-specific differences in range size were associated with the spatial dispersion of productive foraging sites within individual foraging ranges. P. pipistrellus foraging sites were highly dispersed, necessitating larger ranges. It is predicted that the spatial segregation revealed by the present study is a result of selection favouring the avoidance of competition in these species through differential habitat use.},

@article{Heleno2011,
abstract = {Recently, the focus of conservation efforts gradually changed from a species-centred approach to a broader ambition of conserving functional ecosystems. This new approach relies on the understanding that much ecosystem function is a result of the interaction of species to form complex interaction networks. Therefore measures summarising holistic attributes of such ecological networks have the potential to provide useful indicators to guide and assess conservation objectives. The most generally accepted insight is that complexity in species interactions, measured by network connectance, is an important attribute of healthy communities which usually protects them from secondary extinctions. An implicit and overlooked corollary to this generalization is that conservation efforts should be directed to conserve highly connected communities. We conducted a literature review to search for empirical evidence of a relationship between connectance (complexity) and conservation value (communities on different stages of degradation). Our results show that the often assumed positive relationship between highly connected and desirable (i.e. with high conservation value) communities does not derive from empirical data and that the topic deserves further discussion. Given the conflicting empirical evidence revealed in this study, it is clear that connectance on its own cannot provide clear information about conservation value. In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, studies of species interaction networks should incorporate the different 'conservation value' of nodes (i.e. species) in a network if it is to be of practical use in guiding and evaluating conservation practice.},

Species networks are one way to analyze species associations, with a growing number of applications such as food webs, nesting webs, plant-animal mutualisms, and interlinked extinctions. We present a new method for assessing and visualizing patterns of co-occurrence of species. The method depicts interactions and associations in an analogous way with existing network diagrams for studying pollination and trophic interactions, but adds the assessment of sign, strength, and direction of the associations. This provides a distinct advantage over existing methods of quantifying and visualizing co-occurrence. We demonstrate the utility of our new approach by showing differences in associations among woodland bird species found in different habitats and by illustrating the way these can be interpreted in terms of underlying ecological mechanisms. Our new method is computationally feasible for large assemblages and provides readily interpretable effects with standard errors. It has wide applications for quantifying species associations within ecological communities, examining questions about particular species that occur with others, and how their associations can determine the structure and composition of communities.},

The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems protocol provides an adaptable framework for risk assessment across terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine ecosystems. I review a series of detailed case studies, published in this special edition of Austral Ecology, that apply the Red List of Ecosystems criteria to a broad range of ecosystem types. These studies show that detailed risk assessments are especially valuable as forerunners to strategic ecosystem management. Key components of Red List assessments that contribute to development of management strategies include critical diagnosis of trends and their causes, identification of dependencies that influence ecosystem responses to environmental change and selection of ecosystem-specific diagnostic variables that can be useful monitoring tools for evaluating the performance of management. Ecosystem Red List assessments are crucial to regulatory processes under environmental legislation in Australia and other countries. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem criteria will help improve the scientific rigour of statutory listings and could also provide a unifying framework for the suite of listing processes that differ among jurisdictions for historical reasons. When integrated with a comprehensive ecosystem typology, ecosystem Red List assessments can also provide critical input into systematic conservation planning. The case studies demonstrate a range of analytical approaches to risk assessment framed to accommodate data of varying quality and abundance. I conclude by exploring opportunities and requirements for a systematic continental-scale Red List assessment of Australian ecosystems.},

abstract = {Aim To develop a new probabilistic model that can be used to test for statistically significant pair-wise patterns of species co-occurrence. The model gives the prob- ability that two specieswould co-occur at a frequency less than (or greater than) the observed frequency if the two species were distributed independently of one another among a set of sites. Themodel can be used to classify species associations as negative, positive or random. Innovation Historically, the analysis of species co-occurrence has involved the use of data randomization. An observed species presence–absence matrix is compared with randomized matrices to determine if the observed matrix has structure, either an excess or deficit of species positively or negatively associated with each other. The computer algorithms used to randomize matrices can sometimes produce Type I and Type II errors (when the randomization algorithm produces a biased set of all possible matrices) due to the randomization process itself. The probabilistic model does not rely on any data randomization, hence it has a very lowType I error rate and is powerful having a low Type II error rate. Main conclusionsWhen applied to 10 different data sets the probabilistic model revealed significant positive and negative species associations in most of the data sets. Compared with previous analyses the model tended to find fewer significant associations; this may indicate a generally lowrate of Type I error in the model. The model is easy to implement and requires no special software. The model could potentially transform the way that ecologists test for species co-occurrence in a wide range of ecological studies.

He emphasizes the bypassing of issues with randomization analyses and the reduction of Type I and Type II errors, as this is an analytical approach.

However, it is fast and fairly simple to code, and produces results the author is comfortable with. 

It is possible to correct the sampling issue to improve this algorithm and simplify Veech's equation. Will use this probabilistic approach with correction in future network analyses.},

abstract = {Two species of Andean brush-finches, Buarremon (formerly Atlapetes) torquatus and B. brunneinuchu{\$}, show an interdigitating pattern of distribution in the Andes that we interpret as the result of competition between them. Plotting 590 specimen localities by latitude and elevation reveals that the two species have complementary, parapatric distributions with minimal overlap. More importantly, where only one species occurs, that species usually occupies the entire elevational range in that region. Furthermore, the usual relative position of the two species, with B. torquatus at high and B. brunneinuchus at low elevations, is reversed in two regions. These "natural experiments" suggest that elevational limits are unlikely to be governed in these two species by autecological factors and that interspecific competition is the process most likely to generate such a pattern. However, our re-evaluation of other data interpreted to support the prevalence of interspecific competition in determining elevational limits of other Andean birds suggests that its role has not been properly resolved. BIRD DISTRIBUTIONS in the Andes Mountains are characterized by vertical segregation and relatively uniform elevational ranges throughout the range of each species (Chapman 1917, 1926). One striking exception to this generalization is the elevational distribution of Buar-remon (formerly Atlapetes; see below) torquatus (Stripe-headed Brush-Finch; Emberizinae), which in some areas occurs from near timber-line to the lower limit of cloud forest, but in other areas has a narrow elevational distribution (Paynter 1978, Hilty and Brown 1986, Fjeld-sl and Krabbe 1990). Paynter (1978) and Fjelds• and Krabbe (1990) proposed that the areas where B. torquatus occupied narrow elevational ranges corresponded to those areas where a congener, B. brunneinu-chus (Chestnut-capped Brush-Finch), was present , suggesting that interspecific competition governed elevational limits in these two species. Their similarity in body size, shape, plum-age, foraging behavior (mainly terrestrial), and habitat (undergrowth of humid montane forest) makes these brush-finches likely competitors. The purpose of our analysis was to evaluate this hypothesis by plotting precisely the latitudinal and elevational distributions of the two species, and then comparing the distribution of B. tor-quatus in areas with and without B. brunneinu-chus. The interspecific competition hypothesis predicts that the two distributions should be complementary, with perhaps minimal sym-patty where ranges abut and, more importantly, that one species should expand its range of elevations where the other is absent. Other hypotheses , such as the autecological hypothesis or the historical-accident hypothesis (Remsen and Cardiff 1990), predict that the distributions of the two species should be independent of one another within the same habitat, climato-logical, or zoogeographic region, and that ele-vational limits of one species should not change where the other is missing. Although Paynter (1978) previously mapped latitudinal distributions of Buarremon brush-finches from collecting localities, he was unable to analyze elevational distributions in a similar way because of the absence of elevational data from many collecting localities. However, with the recent completion of the gazetteers for all the Andean countries by Paynter and his colleagues (Paynter et al. 1975, Paynter and Traylot 1977, 1981, Paynter 1982, 1985, Stephens and Traylot 1983), mapping of elevational distributions is now feasible. Furthermore, 15 years of additional fieldwork since Paynter's analysis (1978) has generated much additional locality data, particularly in Peru and Bolivia.

abstract = {The composition of ecological assemblages depends on a variety of factors including environmental filtering, biotic interactions and dispersal limitation. By evaluating the phylogenetic pattern of assemblages, we gain insight into the relative contribution of these mechanisms to generating observed assemblages. We address some limitations in the field of community phylogenetics by using simulations, biologically relevant null models, and cost distance analysis to evaluate simultaneous mechanisms leading to observed patterns of co-occurrence. Building from past studies of phylogenetic community structure, we applied our approach to hummingbird assemblages in the Northern Andes. We compared the relationship between relatedness and co-occurrence among predicted assemblages, based on estimates of suitable habitat and dispersal limitation, and observed assemblages. Hummingbird co-occurrence peaked at intermediate relatedness and decreased when a closely-related species was present. This result was most similar to simulations that included simultaneous effects of phylogenetic conservatism and repulsion. In addition, we found older sister taxa were only weakly more separated by geographic barriers, suggesting that time since dispersal is unlikely to be the sole factor influencing co-occurrence of closely related species. Our analysis highlights the role of multiple mechanisms acting simultaneously, and provides a hypothesis for the potential importance of competition at regional scales.},

@article{Harris2016,
abstract = {Inferring species interactions from co-occurrence data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that outcompetes both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known interactions, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. Markov networks consistently outperformed the other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, which controlled for indirect effects with partial correlations or generalized linear models, also performed well. Null models showed no evidence of being able to control for indirect effects, and reliably yielded incorrect inferences when such effects were present.},

In the cattle-raising ecosystem, the vampire bat population is almost two times larger than in the natural ecosystem.

The capture in both ecosystems of a larger proportion of males confirms that each sex has different patterns of activity and suggests the existence of division of work.},

M. daubentoni emerged from the roost after dusk, flew fast and low over water and around riparian vegetation and foraged on long, straight beats. They frequently foraged in groups, and fed opportunistically on insects which fly in swarms in riparian habitats.

abstract = {Throughout evolution the foraging and echolocation behaviors as well as the motor systems of bats have been adapted to the tasks they have to perform while searching and acquiring food. When bats exploit the same class of environmental resources in a similar way, they perform comparable tasks and thus share similar adaptations independent of their phylogeny. Species with similar adaptations are assigned to guilds or functional groups. Habitat type and foraging mode mainly determine the foraging tasks and thus the adaptations of bats. Therefore we use habitat type and foraging mode to define seven guilds. The habitat types open, edge and narrow space are defined according to the bats' echolocation behavior in relation to the distance between bat and background or food item and background. Bats foraging in the aerial, trawling, flutter detecting, or active gleaning mode use only echolocation to acquire their food. When foraging in the passive gleaning mode bats do not use echolocation but rely on sensory cues from the food item to find it. Bat communities often comprise large numbers of species with a high diversity in foraging areas, foraging modes, and diets. The assignment of species living under similar constraints into guilds identifies pattern of community structure and helps to understand the factors that underlie the organization of highly diverse bat communities. Bat species from different guilds do not compete for food as they differ in their foraging behavior and in the environmental resources they use. However, sympatric living species belonging to the same guild often exploit the same class of resources. To avoid competition they should differ in their niche dimensions. The fine grain structure of bat communities below the rather coarse classification into guilds is determined by mechanisms that result in niche partitioning.},

This paper compares biotic interactions to co-occurrences and reveals that co-occurrences generally cannot be expected to reliably predict the presence of biotic interactions. The paper uses a well-studied and intensively sampled rocky intertidal zone as its model habitat. They also show that there is a difference in the detection rate of different interaction types, positive non-trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation being the most easily detected by co-occurrence. 

This information reinforces my statement in my ch1 that co-occurrences cannot be treated like interactions. However, it also reinforces the results of the Blois analysis in Chapter 2, which has a small proportion of biotic interactions which are all positive (and based on past experience, non-trophic).},
