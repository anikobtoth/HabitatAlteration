abstract = {Abstract. J. M. Diamond's assembly rules model predicts that competitive interactions between species lead to nonrandom co-occurrence patterns. We conducted a meta-analysis of 96 published presence–absence matrices and used a realistic ‘‘null model'' to generate patterns expected in the absence of species interactions. Published matrices were highly nonrandom and matched the predictions of Diamond's model: there were fewer species combinations, more checkerboard species pairs, and less co-occurrence in real matrices than expected by chance. Moreover, nonrandom structure was greater in homeotherm vs. poikilotherm matrices. Although these analyses do not confirm the mechanisms of Dia- mond's controversial assembly rules model, they do establish that observed co-occurrence in most natural communities is usually less than expected by chance. These results contrast with previous analyses of species co-occurrence patterns and bridge the apparent gap be- tween experimental and correlative studies in community ecology. Key},

abstract = {Veech (2013, Global Ecology and Biogeography, 22, 252–260) introduced a formula to calculate the probability of two species co-occurring in various sites under the assumption of statistical independence between the two distributional patterns. He presented his model as a new procedure, a ‘pairwise approach', different from analyses of whole presence–absence matrices to examine patterns of co-occurrence. Here I show that: (1) Veech's method is identical to Fisher's exact test, a standard procedure for measuring the statistical association between two discrete variables; (2) in a broad sense, the pairwise approach is very similar to early analyses of spatial association, such as the one advanced by Forbes in 1907; (3) implicit in Veech's formula is a sampling scheme that is indistinguishable from well-known matrix-level null models that randomize the distribution of species among equiprobable sites; (4) pairwise co-occurrence patterns can be analysed using any matrix-level null model, so pairwise comparisons are not limited to using Veech's formula. The methodological distinction that Veech proposed between pairwise and matrix-level approaches does not in fact exist, although the conceptual distinction between the two approaches is still a debated topic.},
annote = {Arita basically attacks Veech on the grounds that his probabilistic approach is distinctly not novel and that his assessment of co-occurrence measures distinguish unnecessarily between matrix-wide and pairwise measures. He shows using arithmetic and simulations that Veech's approach is indistinguishable from Fisher's exact test and analogous to SIM2 (Gotelli 2000). 

The argument about Fisher's hypergeometric test seems pretty solid, though I'm unconvinced that the emphasis on the F-E SIM2 algorithm was warranted. Veech recognized the conceptual connection between his algorithm and SIM2, but asserted that his algorithm sidesteps the error problems with randomizations. This paper did not mention errors. Veech did fail to recognize the connection between his approach and Fisher's exact test.},

abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

abstract = {The choice of measures used to estimate the richness of species, genera, or higher taxa is a crucial matter in paleobiology and ecology. This paper evaluates four methods called shareholder quorum subsampling, true richness estimated using a Poisson sampling model (TRiPS), squares, and the corrected first-order jackknife (cJ1). Quorum subsampling interpolates to produce a relative richness estimate, while the other three extrapolate to the size of the overall species pool. Here I use routine ecological data to show that squares and cJ1 pass several basic validation tests, but TRiPS does not. First, TRiPS estimates are insensitive to the shape of abundance distributions, being entirely predicted by total counts of species and of individuals regardless of the details. Furthermore, TRiPS tends not to extrapolate at all when sampling is moderate or intense. Second, all three extrapolators yield lower values when they work with small uniform subsamples of large raw inventories. The third test is a split-analyze-and-sum analysis: each inventory is divided between the most common and least common halves of the abundance distribution, the methods are applied to the half-inventories, and the estimates are summed. Squares and cJ1 perform well here, but TRiPS does not extrapolate as long as the full inventories are reasonably well-sampled. It is otherwise not particularly accurate. The extrapolators are largely insensitive to the influence of abundance distribution evenness, as quantified using Pielou's J and a new index called the ratio of means. Quorum subsampling generally performs well, but it stumbles on the split-analyze-and-sum test and is confounded somewhat by evenness.},

This complexity arising from the evidence of context-dependencies has underscored a difficulty in establishing a systematic analysis about the extent to which species interactions are expected to switch in nature and experiments. Here, we propose an overarching theoretical framework, by integrating probabilistic and structural approaches, to establish null expectations about switches of interaction classes across environmental contexts.

We present a new method for testing this question; this method lets one not only examine whether a whole fauna is non-randomly structured, but also identify in which direction and by how much each particular species combination deviates from expectations based on randomness. Application of this method to the whole Bismarck and New Hebridean avifaunas, and to two particular guilds, shows that some pairs of species have more exclusive distributions than expected for random placement of species, because of competition, differing distributional strategies, or different geographical orgins. Other pairs of species have more coincident distributions than expected, because of shared habitat, single-island endemism, shared distributional strategies, or shared geographical origins. Much of the information about non-random co-occurrence is contained in the incidence graphs for occurrence of individual species.

@article{Fraser2020,
abstract = {Recent renewed interest in using fossil data to understand how biotic interactions have shaped the evolution of life is challenging the widely held assumption that long-term climate changes are the primary drivers of biodiversity change. New approaches go beyond traditional richness and co-occurrence studies to explicitly model biotic interactions using data on fossil and modern biodiversity. Important developments in three primary areas of research include analysis of (i) macroevolutionary rates, (ii) the impacts of and recovery from extinction events, and (iii) how humans (Homo sapiens) affected interactions among non-human species. We present multiple lines of evidence for an important and measurable role of biotic interactions in shaping the evolution of communities and lineages on long timescales. Biotic Interactions in the Fossil Record Biotic interactions occur when organisms living in the same community directly or indirectly influence one another. Biotic interactions can occur within or among species, be positive or negative, and cover a wide range of interactions including predation, commensalism, mutualism, resource competition, and parasitism [1]. Biotic interactions play an important role in structuring modern communities (e.g., [2]). Understanding their importance in the past therefore has the potential to shed light on their role in shaping ancient and recent diversity patterns. Historically, however, the study of biotic interactions in the fossil record has largely focused on direct physical evidence of interactions such as bore holes in shells, plant damage by insects, patterns of bryozoan encrustation, rare occurrences of gut contents, and carnivore damage on bones (e.g., [3,4]). Analysis of unusually well-preserved fossil assemblages allows reconstruction of trophic relationships among diverse organisms (e.g., [5]) and earlier work documented long-term trends in ecospace (see Glossary) occupation [6]. However, temporally continuous evidence for biotic interactions (traditionally thought to structure biodiversity on only very limited spatiotemporal scales [7]) with appropriate temporal resolution (i.e., high-resolution stratigraphic sequences) is only rarely preserved. Consequently, paleontologists have focused primarily on the more accessible long-term trends in climate as important regulators of biodiversity and the differential success of species (e.g., [8]); only short-term ecological phenomena or long-term patterns that cannot be explained by climate have typically been attributed to the outcome of biotic interactions (e.g., [9], but see [6]). However, as the only source of sufficiently long-term data, and in light of several recent methodological advances, the fossil record is now uniquely positioned to answer many of the questions at the core of the evolutionary and ecological sciences. Herein, we address important recent advances in understanding the role of biotic interactions in shaping macroevolutionary and macroecological phenomena in the fossil record (Figure 1) and highlight areas of future research we believe will be illuminating. In this review, we exclude studies of physical evidence for interactions, except where they are used to contextualize large-scale biodiversity patterns. Highlights Challenging the widespread perspective that long-term diversity patterns are shaped primarily by climate is not possible without using fossil record data to understand the role of biotic interactions. Important recent development and application of models that utilize data of both living and extinct species have enabled analyses to move beyond simply excluding potential abiotic drivers to explicitly modeling biotic drivers for the first time. Analyses of paleontological data show that biotic interactions shape the temporal diversity trajectories and rates of origination and extinction for numerous taxa. Extinction of keystone species has disproportionate impacts on biotic interactions among surviving species. Recovery from extinction events can be sped up or slowed down by biotic interactions among surviving species. Historically, humans (Homo sapiens) have acted as large, generalist predators, disrupting interaction networks among non-human species.},

abstract = {The end of the Pleistocene was marked by the extinction of almost all large land mammals worldwide except in Africa. Although the debate on Pleisto-cene extinctions has focused on the roles of climate change and humans, the impact of perturbations depends on properties of ecological communities, such as species composition and the organization of ecological interactions. Here, we combined palaeoecological and ecological data, food-web models and community stability analysis to investigate if differences between Pleis-tocene and modern mammalian assemblages help us understand why the megafauna died out in the Americas while persisting in Africa. We show Pleistocene and modern assemblages share similar network topology, but differences in richness and body size distributions made Pleistocene commu-nities significantly more vulnerable to the effects of human arrival. The structural changes promoted by humans in Pleistocene networks would have increased the likelihood of unstable dynamics, which may favour extinction cascades in communities facing extrinsic perturbations. Our find-ings suggest that the basic aspects of the organization of ecological communities may have played an important role in major extinction events in the past. Knowledge of community-level properties and their consequences to dynamics may be critical to understand past and future extinctions.},
annote = {Only paper I know of that really employs a network approach on paleontological large mammals. The authors create a food web of pleistocene megafauna (methods are a bit debatable, there is a lot of indirect evidence and inference of links using body size). They then investigate the effects of losing large megafauna on the network structure and the effects of a new predator (humans). They focus on nestedness and modularity. Their work apparently implies that the arrival of humans resulted in a more fragile network structure than before. Broader implications are that community level properties may play a role in extinction risk and the resilience of species. 

Thoughts: on first read this paper seemed a bit contrived to me, because the networks were inferred, not built with observational data (such as stomach contents). Body size of predators was used to estimate which prey species might be consumed. This seems a bit simplistic to me. But they did use previously published network models which presumably makes the analysis acceptable. Tests showed that about 70% of modern predator-prey interactions are predicted accurately, meaning if similar rules apply (likely) then the paleo food webs are about 70% accurate on average, so some are worse. From what I know about networks, the error in the network models could produce network results that are not reliable in the rest of the study.

This approach also does not take into account prey specialization in large predators and hypercarnivory... 

I found that the authors were not clear on how their measurements of mod and nest translate to their claims about network topology; it seems these claim are mosty based on comparing effects. They say that nestedness may translate to less stability. 

Modern and pleistocene networks apparently had similar structures, but pleistocene assemblages were more sensitive to human arrival, allegedly because of their predator to prey species richness (not topology).},

abstract = {Just as long-term nitrogen loading of grasslands decreases plant species richness and increases plant biomass, we have found that nitrogen loading decreases insect species richness and increases insect abundances. We sampled 54 plots that had been maintained at various rates of nitrogen addition for 14 years. Total insect species richness and effective insect diversity, as well as herbivore and predator species richness, were significantly, negatively related to the rate of nitrogen addition. However, there was variation in trophic responses to nitrogen. Detritivore species richness increased as nitrogen addition increased, and parasitoids showed no response. Insect abundances, measured as the number of insects and insect biovolume (an estimate of biomass), were significantly, positively related to the rate of nitrogen addition, as were the abundances of herbivores and detritivores. Parasitoid abundance was negatively related to the rate of nitrogen addition. Changes in the insect community were correlated with changes in the plant community. As rates of nitrogen addition increased, plant species richness decreased, plant productivity and plant tissue nitrogen increased, and plant composition shifted from C4 to C3 grass species. Along this gradient, total insect species richness and effective insect diversity were most strongly, positively correlated with plant species richness. Insect biovolume was negatively correlated with plant species richness. Responses of individual herbivores varied along the nitrogen gradient, but numbers of 13 of the 18 most abundant herbivores were positively correlated with their host plant biomass. Although insect communities did not respond as strongly asplant communities, insect species richness, abundance, and composition were impacted by nitrogen addition. This study demonstrates that long-term nitrogen loading affects the entire food chain, simplifying both plant and insect communities.},

abstract = {Ecologists widely accept that the distribution of abundances inmost communities is fairly flat but heavily dominated by a few species. The reason for this is that species abundances are thought to follow certain theoretical distribu- tions that predict such a pattern.However, previous studies have focusedon either a fewtheoretical distributions or a few empirical distributions. I illustrate abundance patterns in 1055 samples of trees, bats, small terrestrial mam- mals, birds, lizards, frogs, ants, dung beetles, butterflies, and odonates. Five existing theoretical distributions make inaccurate predictions about the frequencies of the most common species and of the average species, andmost of them fit the overall patterns poorly, according to the maximum likelihood–related Kullback-Leibler divergence statistic. Instead, the data support a low-dominance distribution here called the “double geometric.” Depending on the value of its two governing parameters, itmay resemble either the geometric series distribution or the lognormal series distribution. However, unlike any othermodel, it assumes both that richness is finite and that species compete unequally for resources in a two-dimensional niche landscape,which implies that niche breadths are variable and that trait distributions are neither arrayed along a single dimension nor randomly associated. The hypothesis that niche space ismultidimensional helps to explain how numerous species can coexist despite interacting strongly. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Twenty association coefficients were subjected to an empirical trial on interspecific association data among fungi of the genus Chaetomium, using cluster analysis. The classification produced 5 main clusters of related coefficients, with several subgroups. Representative indices from different clusters yield different dendrograms of interspecific association among Chaetomium. A set of measures that generally work well are named. For some purposes, however, other 'admissible' coefficients would be more optimal, and the choice of a measure should be related to the nature of the data. Three or so alternative coefficients should be used and the results compared on the same data basis; significance tests on association should be carried out whenever possible.-from Author},

abstract = {We assessed the ecomorphological structure of a guild of rhinolophoid bats in a Malaysian rainforest first described by Heller and von Helversen (1989). These authors found that the distribution of echolocation call frequencies used by 12 syntopic species was more even than expected from allometric relationships or in randomly generated communities, and that the observed minimal ratio was greater than expected by chance alone. In this study we were able to expand their guild to 15 species, but in doing so it became apparent that call frequencies might be less evenly distributed across the total frequency range than previously proposed. We rep-licated Heller and von Helversen's (1989) analyses with the full 15-species complement but were unable to support their suggestion that rhinolophoid bats exhibit resource partitioning through differences in frequency bands. We adopted a multivariate approach and incorporated measures of body size and wing morphology into the analysis. We used phylogenetic autocorrelation to ensure that the species were statistically independent and principal component analysis to describe the morphological space occupied by the 15 species in the community and four additional species representing the extremes of phenotypic variation. We derived interspecific Euclidean distances and tested the mean values and SDs of these distances against those of 100 guilds of "synthetic" species created randomly within the principal component space. The guild of Rhinolophoidea was not distributed randomly in multivariate space. Instead we found evidence of morphological overdispersion of the most similar species, which suggests niche differentiation in response to competition. Less similar species were nearer in morphological space than expected, and we suggest this is a consequence of ecological constraints on parameter combinations. Despite this underdispersion, many of the more distant neighbours were evenly rather than randomly spaced or clumped in morphospace, suggesting that, given the environmental constraints on morphology, species in this guild do experience limits to their similarity. Finally, we tested the influence of the relative abundance of species on morphological displacement, and found no evidence that abundant, spatially correlated species reduce interspecific overlap in morphological space.},

abstract = {Throughout evolution the foraging and echolocation behaviors as well as the motor systems of bats have been adapted to the tasks they have to perform while searching and acquiring food. When bats exploit the same class of environmental resources in a similar way, they perform comparable tasks and thus share similar adaptations independent of their phylogeny. Species with similar adaptations are assigned to guilds or functional groups. Habitat type and foraging mode mainly determine the foraging tasks and thus the adaptations of bats. Therefore we use habitat type and foraging mode to define seven guilds. The habitat types open, edge and narrow space are defined according to the bats' echolocation behavior in relation to the distance between bat and background or food item and background. Bats foraging in the aerial, trawling, flutter detecting, or active gleaning mode use only echolocation to acquire their food. When foraging in the passive gleaning mode bats do not use echolocation but rely on sensory cues from the food item to find it. Bat communities often comprise large numbers of species with a high diversity in foraging areas, foraging modes, and diets. The assignment of species living under similar constraints into guilds identifies pattern of community structure and helps to understand the factors that underlie the organization of highly diverse bat communities. Bat species from different guilds do not compete for food as they differ in their foraging behavior and in the environmental resources they use. However, sympatric living species belonging to the same guild often exploit the same class of resources. To avoid competition they should differ in their niche dimensions. The fine grain structure of bat communities below the rather coarse classification into guilds is determined by mechanisms that result in niche partitioning.},

We propose that it can be measured as the average dissimilarity from individual observation units to their group centroid in multivariate space, using an appropriate dissimilarity measure. Differences in beta diversity among different areas or groups of samples can be tested using this approach. The choice of transformation and dissimilarity measure has important consequences for interpreting results. For kelp holdfast assemblages from New Zealand, variation in species composition was greater in smaller holdfasts, while variation in relative abundances was greater in larger holdasts. Variation in community structure of Norwegian continental shelf macrobenthic fauna increased with increases in environmental heterogeneity, regardless of the measure used. We propose a new dissimilarity measure which allows the relative weight placed on changes in composition vs. abundance to be specified explicitly. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Species interactions are dynamic processes that vary across environmental and ecological contexts, and operate across scale boundaries, making them difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, ecologists are increasingly interested in inferring species interactions from observational data using statistical analyses of their spatial co-occurrence patterns. Trophic interactions present a particular challenge, as predators and prey may frequently or rarely co-occur, depending on the spatial or temporal scale of observation. In this study, we investigate the accuracy of inferred interactions among species that both compete and trophically interact. We utilized a long-term dataset of pond-breeding amphibian co-occurrences from Mt Rainier National Park (Washington, USA) and compiled a new dataset of their empirical interactions from the literature. We compared the accuracy of four statistical methods in inferring these known species interactions from spatial associations. We then used the best performing statistical method, the Markov network, to further investigate the sensitivity of interaction inference to spatial scale-dependence and the presence of predators. We show that co-occurrence methods are generally inaccurate when estimating trophic interactions. Further the strength and sign of inferred interactions were dependent upon the spatial scale of observation and predator presence influenced the detectability of competitive interactions among prey species. However, co-occurrence analysis revealed new patterns of spatial association among pairs of species with known interactions. Overall, our study highlights a limiting frontier in co-occurrence theory and the disconnect between widely implemented methodologies and their ability to accurately infer interactions in trophically-structured communities.},

abstract = {A central problem in ecology is to understand how human impacts affect plant–animal interactions that lead to effective seed dispersal services for plant communities. Seed dispersal services are the outcome of plant–frugivore interactions that often form local networks of interacting species. Recent work has shown that some frugivorous bird species are more critical to network organization than others. Here, we explore how patch size and the potential local extinctions of obligate frugivorous birds affect the reorganization of seed dispersal networks. We examined the structure of 20 empirical seed dispersal networks documented across tropical avian assemblages occupying widely variable habitat patch sizes, a surrogate of the amount of remaining habitat. Networks within small forest patches consistently supported both lower plant and bird species richness. Forest patch size was positively associated with nestedness, indicating that reductions in patch size disrupted the nested organization of seed dispersal networks. Obligate frugivores, especially large-bodied species, were almost entirely absent from small forest patches. Analysis at the species level showed that obligate frugivores formed the core of interacting species, connecting species within a given seed dispersal network. Our combined results revealed that patch size reduction erodes frugivorous bird diversity, thereby affecting the integrity of seed dispersal networks. We highlight the importance of conserving large forest patches to maintain tropical forest functionality.},

abstract = {The extent to which resource subsidies affect food web dynamics is poorly understood in anthropogenic landscapes. To better understand how species interactions are influenced by subsidies, we studied breeding birds and nest predators along a rural-to-urban landscape gradient that varied in subsidies provided to generalist predators. We hypothesized that resource subsidies in urban landscapes would decouple predator-prey relationships, as predators switch from natural to anthropogenic foods. From 2004 to 2009, we surveyed nest predators and monitored 2942 nests of five songbird species breeding in 19 mature forest stands in Ohio, USA. Eighteen species were video-recorded depredating nests. Numbers of avian and mammalian nest predators were positively associated with the amount of urban development surrounding forests, with the exception of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Although nest survival strongly declined with detections of nest predators in rural landscapes, nest survival and predator numbers were unrelated in urban landscapes. Thus, the strength of interaction between breeding birds and nest predators diminished as landscapes surrounding forested parks became more urbanized. Our work suggests that decoupling of predator-prey relationships can arise when synanthropic predators are heavily subsidized by anthropogenic resources. In this way, human drivers can alter, and completely disarticulate, relationships among species that are well established in more natural systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Agricultural land use results in direct biodiversity decline through loss of natural habitat, but may also cause indirect cross-habitat effects on conservation areas. We conducted three landscape-scale field studies on 67 sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) results in a transient dilution of bees in crop fields, and in increased competition between crop plants and grassland plants for pollinators. Abundances of bumble-bees, which are the main pollinators of the grassland plant Primula veris, but also pollinate oilseed rape (OSR), decreased with increasing amount of OSR. This landscape-scale dilution affected bumble-bee abundances strongly in OSR fields and marginally in grasslands, where bumble-bee abundances were generally low at the time of Primula flowering. Seed set of Primula veris, which flowers during OSR bloom, was reduced by 20 per cent when the amount of OSR within 1 km radius increased from 0 to 15 per cent. Hence, the current expansion of bee-attractive biofuel crops results in transient dilution of crop pollinators, which means an increased competition for pollinators between crops and wild plants. In conclusion, mass-flowering crops potentially threaten fitness of concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas, despite the fact that, in the long run, mass-flowering crops can enhance abundances of generalist pollinators and their pollination service. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

Here, we addressed this challenge in experimental microbial microcosms by employing empirical dynamic modelling tools to: (1) detect causal interactions between prey species in the absence and presence of a predator; (2) quantify the time-varying strength of these interactions and (3) explore stability in the resulting communities. Our findings show that predators boost the number of causal interactions among community members, and lead to reduced dynamic stability, but higher coexistence among prey species. These results correspond to time-varying changes in species interactions, including emergence of morphological characteristics that appeared to reduce predation, and indirectly facilitate growth of predator-susceptible species. Jointly, our findings suggest that careful consideration of both context and time may be necessary to predict and explain outcomes in multi-trophic systems.},

abstract = {Throughout the last two decades, Bayesian statistical methods have proliferated throughout ecology and evolution. Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer's guide' to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference' prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default' prior for any Bayesian model.},

abstract = {A three-phase kinetic model with time-specific perturbations is used to describe large-scale patterns in the diversification of Phanerozoic marine families. The basic model assumes that the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modem evolutionary faunas each diversified logistically as a consequence of early exponential growth and of later slowing of growth as the ecosystems became filled; it also assumes interaction among the evolutionary faunas such that expansion of the combined diversities of all three faunas above any single fauna's equilibrium caused that fauna's diversity to begin to decline. This basic model adequately describes the diversification of the evolutionary faunas through the Paleozoic Era as well as the asymmetrical rise and fall of background extinction rates through the entire Phanerozoic. Declines in diversity and changes in faunal dominance associated with mass extinctions can be accommodated in the model with short-term accelerations in extinction rates or declines in equilibria. Such accelerations, or perturbations, cause diversity to decline exponentially and then to rebound sigmoidally following release. The amount of decline is dependent on the magnitude and duration of the perturbation, the timing of the perturbation with respect to the diversification of the system, and the system's initial per-taxon rates of diversification and turnover. When applied to the three-phase model, such perturbations describe the changes in diversity and faunal dominance during and after major mass extinctions, the long-term rise in total diversity following the Late Permian and Norian mass extinctions, and the peculiar diversification and then decline of the remnants of the Paleozoic fauna during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras. The good fit of this model to data on Phanerozoic familial diversity suggests that many of the large-scale patterns of diversification seen in the marine fossil record of animal families are simple consequences of nonlinear interrelationships among a small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the evolutionary faunas and are largely (but not completely) invariant through time. {\textcopyright} 1984, Paleontological Society.

abstract = {A central tenet of ecology and biogeography is that the broad outlines of species ranges are determined by climate, whereas the effects of biotic interactions are manifested at local scales. While the first proposition is supported by ample evidence, the second is still a matter of controversy. To address this question, we develop a mathematical model that predicts the spatial overlap, i.e. co-occurrence, between pairs of species subject to all possible types of interactions. We then identify the scale of resolution in which predicted range overlaps are lost. We found that co-occurrence arising from positive interactions, such as mutualism (+/+) and commensalism (+/0), are manifested across scales. Negative interactions, such as competition (-/-) and amensalism (-/0), generate checkerboard patterns of co-occurrence that are discernible at finer resolutions but that are lost and increasing scales of resolution. Scale dependence in consumer-resource interactions (+/-) depends on the strength of positive dependencies between species. If the net positive effect is greater than the net negative effect, then interactions scale up similarly to positive interactions. Our results challenge the widely held view that climate alone is sufficient to characterize species distributions at broad scales, but also demonstrate that the spatial signature of competition is unlikely to be discernible beyond local and regional scales.},

abstract = {Group-level variance estimates of zero often arise when fitting multilevel or hierarchical linear mod- els, especially when the number of groups is small. For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informa- tive prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2,$\lambda$) penalty with $\lambda$→0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior. Our default method provides better estimates of model parameters and standard errors than the max- imum likelihood or the restricted maximum likelihood estimators. The log-gamma family can also be used to convey substantive prior information. In either case—pure penalization or prior information—our rec- ommended procedure gives nondegenerate estimates and in the limit coincides with maximum likelihood as the number of groups increases.

The interplay between these environmental factors makes it hard to discern whether ecological competition exerts an upper limit on species richness. Here, using the exceptional fossil record of Cenozoic Era macroperforate planktonic foraminifera, we assess the evidence for alternative modes of macroevolutionary competition. Our models support an environmentally dependent macroevolutionary form of contest competition that yields finite upper bounds on species richness. Models of biotic competition assuming unchanging environmental conditions were overwhelmingly rejected. In the best-supported model, temperature affects the per-lineage diversification rate, while both temperature and an environmental driver of sediment accumulation defines the upper limit. The support for contest competition implies that incumbency constrains species richness by restricting niche availability, and that the number of macroevolutionary niches varies as a function of environmental changes.},

abstract = {Questions: Can the difference between chance and pattern be determined by the composition of species across islands in an archipelago? In particular, will one find 'checkerboards' - a pattern of mutual exclusivity that is the simplest pattern that might occur under competitive exclusion? Organisms: 150 and 141 species of land birds inhabiting 41 and 142 islands of the Bismarck and the Solomon Archipelagos, respectively. (See http://evolutionary-ecology.com/data/ 2447-Supplement.pdf) Analytical methods: For each pair of species within each archipelago, the observed number of co-occurrences is compared to the distribution of the number of co-occurrences derived from a collection of 106 representative unique random, or null, communities. Those species pairs actually co-occurring less often than they do in 5% of those nulls are 'unusually negative' pairs; those co-occurring more often than they do in 95% of those nulls are 'unusually positive' pairs. Islands are ranked from those with the smallest number of species to the largest. A species incidence is the span from the smallest to the largest number of species on islands on which it is found. Results: In each archipelago, proportionately more congeneric species pairs than non-congeneric species pairs are unusually negative pairs. This holds even for species pairs that overlap in their incidences. Among congeneric species pairs found in both archipelagos, a pair that is unusual in one archipelago generally proves to be unusual in the other archipelago as well and to belong to a genus segregating ecologically by means of spatial niche differences. Conclusions: Diamond (1975) suggested that island bird communities were structured by assembly rules that could be deduced by observation of which species did or did not co-occur on particular islands. Critics countered with analyses arguing that co-occurrence patterns in several ecological communities did not differ from random expectations. We conclude that the difference between chance and pattern can be unequivocally determined. {\textcopyright} 2009 Stuart L. Pimm.},

Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering, and other applications. The authors focus on examining the way a response variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment, and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables. The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions. Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

However, alpha may be underestimated in communities in which the spatial arrangement of individuals is strongly clustered, or in which the total number of species does not tend to infinity. We have extended Fisher's curve to allow for an accurate calibration of Fisher's alpha in such communities. In spite of its good performance, the use of this extended curve is complicated by its optimization procedure. Therefore, we have simulated the extended Fisher curve by modifying the smooth expolinear curve, using three ecologically meaningful parameters only, i.e. Fisher's alpha, a coefficient describing the effects of clustering and the maximum number of species. The resulting equations successfully describe species-individual relationships from both spatial and temporal observations on both plant and animal communities. This family of equations combines three advantages: Fisher's alpha can be quantified more accurately, the number of estimated parameters is flexible and can be kept to a minimum, while all parameters can legitimately be compared across sites. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Existing literature has focused on estimating global extinction rates indirectly or on quantifying effects only at local and regional scales. This paper directly predicts global losses in 11 groups of organisms that would ensue from disturbance of all remaining tropical forest habitats. The results are based on applying a highly accurate method of estimating species richness to 875 ecological samples. About 41% of the tree and animal species in this dataset are absent from disturbed habitats, even though most samples do still represent forests of some kind. The individual figures are 30% for trees and 8-65% for 10 animal groups. Local communities are more robust to disturbance because losses are partially balanced out by gains resulting from homogenization.},

These changes can be broadly grouped according to three nonexclusive mechanisms: (a) changes in the species composition of the networks (driven by interaction patterns of invaders, nonrandom extinction of species according to their traits, or differences among species in population responses across gradients); (b) changes that alter interaction frequencies via changes in search efficiency (driven by altered habitat structure or metabolic rates) or changes in spatial and temporal overlap; and (c) changes to coevolutionary processes and patterns. Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to environmental change.

abstract = {Climate change is asymmetrically altering environmental conditions in space, from local to global scales, creating novel heterogeneity. Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize — or rewire — food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring — a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring — changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web's interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists' responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

Here we show that increasing the species diversity of a functional group of aquatic organisms induces facilitative interactions, leading to non-additive changes in resource consumption. We increased the richness and evenness of suspension-feeding caddisfly larvae (Insecta, Trichoptera) in stream mesocosms and found that the increased topographical complexity of the benthic habitat alters patterns of near-bed flow such that the feeding success of individuals is enhanced. Species diversity reduces 'current shading' (that is, the deceleration of flow from upstream to downstream neighbours), allowing diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources than is caught by any species monoculture. The fundamental nature of this form of hydrodynamic facilitation suggests that it is broadly applicable to freshwater and marine habitats; in addition, it has several analogues in terrestrial ecosystems where fluxes of energy and matter can be influenced by biophysical complexity3,5,6. Thus, changes in species diversity may alter the probability of positive species interactions, resulting in disproportionately large changes in the functioning of ecosystems.},

The paper uses a well-studied and intensively sampled rocky intertidal zone as its model habitat. They also show that there is a difference in the detection rate of different interaction types, positive non-trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation being the most easily detected by co-occurrence. 

This information reinforces my statement in my ch1 that co-occurrences cannot be treated like interactions.

It has been thought that long-term changes in the dominance of major taxonomic groups can be predicted from these characteristics. However, new analyses show that diversity limits may rise or fall in response to adaptive radiations or extinctions. These changes are idiosyncratic and occur at different times in each taxa. For example, the end-Permian mass extinction permanently reduced the diversity of important, previously dominant groups such as brachiopods and crinoids. The current global crisis may therefore permanently alter the biosphere's taxonomic composition by changing the rules of evolution.},

abstract = {Viable populations of species occur in a given place if three conditions are met: the environment at the place is suitable; the species is able to colonize it; co-occurrence is possible despite or because of interactions with other species. Studies investigating the effects of climate change on species have mainly focused on measuring changes in climate suitability. Complex interactions among species have rarely been explored in such studies. We extend network theory to the analysis of complex patterns of co-occurrence among species. The framework is used to explore the robustness of networks under climate change. With our data, we show that networks describing the geographic pattern of co-occurrence among species display properties shared by other complex networks, namely that most species are poorly connected to other species in the network and only a few are highly connected. In our example, species more exposed to climate change tended to be poorly connected to other species within the network, while species more connected tended to be less exposed. Such high connectance would make the co-occurrence networks more robust to climate change. The proposed framework illustrates how network analysis could be used, together with co-occurrence data, to help addressing the potential consequences of species interactions in studies of climate change and biodiversity. However, more research is needed to test for links between co-occurrence and network interactions.},

abstract = {Interspecific spatial associations (ISA), which include co-occurrences, segregations, or attractions among two or more species, can provide important insights into the spatial structuring of communities. However, ISA has primarily been examined in the context of understanding interspecific interactions, while other aspects of ISA, including its relations to other biodiversity facets and how it changes in the face of anthropogenic pressures, have been largely neglected. This is likely because it is unclear what makes ISA useful in a biodiversity context, little is known about the theoretical connections between ISA and other biodiversity facets, and there is a confusing variety of approaches to measuring ISA. Here, we first review the metrics of ISA. These include spatially implicit and explicit indices of association for binary, abundance, and point pattern data. We test and compare these approaches on empirical and simulated data, and we provide recommendations for how to use and interpret them in biodiversity science. We argue that measurements of ISA are more informative when they are spatially explicit (i.e., distance dependent). We then review links of ISA to other classical biodiversity facets, such as alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, and show that they mostly fail to reflect changes/variation in ISA, with the exception of average pairwise beta diversity. This underscores the need for a specific focus on ISA in large-scale biodiversity assessments. Finally, we argue that there are important, and underappreciated, reasons to study ISA that are unrelated to its link to biotic interactions. Specifically, ISA can provide strong tests of biodiversity theories that require multiple patterns to benchmark against, and it can be explored for potentially predictive macroecological patterns.},

abstract = {Pollinators provide crucial ecosystem services that underpin to wild plant reproduction and yields of insect-pollinated crops. Understanding the relative impacts of anthropogenic pressures and climate on the structure of plant–pollinator interaction networks is vital considering ongoing global change and pollinator decline. Our ability to predict the consequences of global change for pollinator assemblages worldwide requires global syntheses, but these analytical approaches may be hindered by variable methods among studies that either invalidate comparisons or mask biological phenomena. Here we conducted a synthetic analysis that assesses the relative impact of anthropogenic pressures and climatic variability, and accounts for heterogeneity in sampling methodology to reveal network responses at the global scale. We analyzed an extensive dataset, comprising 295 networks over 123 locations all over the world, and reporting over 50,000 interactions between flowering plant species and their insect visitors. Our study revealed that anthropogenic pressures correlate with an increase in generalism in pollination networks while pollinator richness and taxonomic composition are more related to climatic variables with an increase in dipteran pollinator richness associated with cooler temperatures. The contrasting response of species richness and generalism of the plant–pollinator networks stresses the importance of considering interaction network structure alongside diversity in ecological monitoring. In addition, differences in sampling design explained more variation than anthropogenic pressures or climate on both pollination networks richness and generalism, highlighting the crucial need to report and incorporate sampling design in macroecological comparative studies of pollination networks. As a whole, our study reveals a potential human impact on pollination networks at a global scale. However, further research is needed to evaluate potential consequences of loss of specialist species and their unique ecological interactions and evolutionary pathways on the ecosystem pollination function at a global scale.},

@article{Plummer2006,
abstract = {At first sight, Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) appears to be straightforward. The user defines a full probability model, perhaps using one of the programs discussed in this issue; an underlying sampling engine takes the model definition and returns a sequence of dependent samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the supplied data. The user can derive any summary of the posterior distribution from this sample. For example, to calculate a 95% credible interval for a parameter $\alpha$, it suffices to take 1000 MCMC iterations of $\alpha$ and sort them so that $\alpha$1<$\alpha$2<...<$\alpha$1000. The credible interval estimate is then ($\alpha$25, $\alpha$975). However, there is a price to be paid for this simplicity. Unlike most numerical methods used in statistical inference, MCMC does not give a clear indication of whether it has converged. The underlying Markov chain theory only guarantees that the distribution of the output will converge to the posterior in the limit as the number of iterations increases to infinity. The user is generally ignorant about how quickly convergence occurs, and therefore has to fall back on post hoc testing of the sampled output. By convention, the sample is divided into two parts: a “burn in” period during which all samples are discarded, and the remainder of the run in which the chain is considered to have converged sufficiently close to the limiting distribution to be used. Two questions then arise: 1. How long should the burn in period be? 2. How many samples are required to accurately estimate posterior quantities of interest? The coda package for R contains a set of functions designed to help the user answer these questions. Some of these convergence diagnostics are simple graphical ways of summarizing the data. Others are formal statistical tests.},

abstract = {Two species of Andean brush-finches, Buarremon (formerly Atlapetes) torquatus and B. brunneinuchu$, show an interdigitating pattern of distribution in the Andes that we interpret as the result of competition between them. Plotting 590 specimen localities by latitude and elevation reveals that the two species have complementary, parapatric distributions with minimal overlap. More importantly, where only one species occurs, that species usually occupies the entire elevational range in that region. Furthermore, the usual relative position of the two species, with B. torquatus at high and B. brunneinuchus at low elevations, is reversed in two regions. These "natural experiments" suggest that elevational limits are unlikely to be governed in these two species by autecological factors and that interspecific competition is the process most likely to generate such a pattern. However, our re-evaluation of other data interpreted to support the prevalence of interspecific competition in determining elevational limits of other Andean birds suggests that its role has not been properly resolved. BIRD DISTRIBUTIONS in the Andes Mountains are characterized by vertical segregation and relatively uniform elevational ranges throughout the range of each species (Chapman 1917, 1926). One striking exception to this generalization is the elevational distribution of Buar-remon (formerly Atlapetes; see below) torquatus (Stripe-headed Brush-Finch; Emberizinae), which in some areas occurs from near timber-line to the lower limit of cloud forest, but in other areas has a narrow elevational distribution (Paynter 1978, Hilty and Brown 1986, Fjeld-sl and Krabbe 1990). Paynter (1978) and Fjelds• and Krabbe (1990) proposed that the areas where B. torquatus occupied narrow elevational ranges corresponded to those areas where a congener, B. brunneinu-chus (Chestnut-capped Brush-Finch), was present , suggesting that interspecific competition governed elevational limits in these two species. Their similarity in body size, shape, plum-age, foraging behavior (mainly terrestrial), and habitat (undergrowth of humid montane forest) makes these brush-finches likely competitors. The purpose of our analysis was to evaluate this hypothesis by plotting precisely the latitudinal and elevational distributions of the two species, and then comparing the distribution of B. tor-quatus in areas with and without B. brunneinu-chus. The interspecific competition hypothesis predicts that the two distributions should be complementary, with perhaps minimal sym-patty where ranges abut and, more importantly, that one species should expand its range of elevations where the other is absent. Other hypotheses , such as the autecological hypothesis or the historical-accident hypothesis (Remsen and Cardiff 1990), predict that the distributions of the two species should be independent of one another within the same habitat, climato-logical, or zoogeographic region, and that ele-vational limits of one species should not change where the other is missing. Although Paynter (1978) previously mapped latitudinal distributions of Buarremon brush-finches from collecting localities, he was unable to analyze elevational distributions in a similar way because of the absence of elevational data from many collecting localities. However, with the recent completion of the gazetteers for all the Andean countries by Paynter and his colleagues (Paynter et al. 1975, Paynter and Traylot 1977, 1981, Paynter 1982, 1985, Stephens and Traylot 1983), mapping of elevational distributions is now feasible. Furthermore, 15 years of additional fieldwork since Paynter's analysis (1978) has generated much additional locality data, particularly in Peru and Bolivia.

This knowledge gap is troubling because ecosystem services have been widely adopted as a justification for global biodiversity conservation. Here we show that, to provide crop pollination in natural systems, the number of bee species must increase by at least one order of magnitude compared with that in field experiments. This increase is driven by species turnover and its interaction with functional dominance, mechanisms that emerge only at large scales.

abstract = {Understanding how ecological communities are organized and how they change through time is critical to predicting the effects of climate change. Recent work documenting the co-occurrence structure of modern communities found that most significant species pairs co-occur less frequently than would be expected by chance. However, little is known about how co-occurrence structure changes through time. Here we evaluate changes in plant and animal community organization over geological time by quantifying the co-occurrence structure of 359,896 unique taxon pairs in 80 assemblages spanning the past 300 million years. Co-occurrences of most taxon pairs were statistically random, but a significant fraction were spatially aggregated or segregated. Aggregated pairs dominated from the Carboniferous period (307 million years ago) to the early Holocene epoch (11,700 years before present), when there was a pronounced shift to more segregated pairs, a trend that continues in modern assemblages. The shift began during the Holocene and coincided with increasing human population size4,5 and the spread of agriculture in North America6,7. Before the shift, an average of 64% of significant pairs were aggregated; after the shift, the average dropped to 37%. The organization of modern and late Holocene plant and animal assemblages differs fundamentally from that of assemblages over the past 300 million years that predate the large-scale impacts of humans. Our results suggest that the rules governing the assembly of communities have recently been changed by human activity.},

abstract = {Aim: There is a debate as to whether biotic interactions exert a dominant role in governing species distributions at macroecological scales. The prevailing idea is that climate is the key limiting factor; thus models that use present-day climate–species range relationships are expected to provide reasonable means to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions. However, there is little empirical evidence that biotic interactions would not constrain species distributions at macroecological scales. We examine this idea, for the first time, and provide tests for two null hypotheses: ( H 0 1) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in explaining current distributions of a particular species of butterfly (clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne ) in Europe; and ( H 0 2) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in predictions of altered species' ranges under climate change. Location: Europe. Methods: Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was used to investigate relationships between species and climate; species and host plants; and species and climate + host plants. Because models are sensitive to the variable selection strategies utilised, four alternative approaches were used: AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), BRUTO (Adaptive Backfitting), and CROSS (Cross Selection). Results: In spite of the variation in the variables selected with different methods, both hypotheses ( H 0 1 and H 0 2) were falsified, providing support for the proposition that biotic interactions significantly affect both the explanatory and predictive power of bioclimatic envelope models at macro scales. Main conclusions: Our results contradict the widely held view that the effects of biotic interactions on individual species distributions are not discernible at macroecological scales. Results are contingent on the species, type of interaction and methods considered, but they call for more stringent evidence in support of the idea that purely climate-based modelling would be sufficient to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions.},

Although shifting climate drove an increase in niche overlap, co-occurrence decreased, signaling shifts in biotic interactions. Furthermore, the effect of abiotic factors on co-occurrence remained constant over time while the effect of biotic factors decreased. Biotic factors apparently played a key role in continental-scale community assembly before the extinctions.

abstract = {The potential for large-scale biodiversity losses as a result of climate change and human impact presents major challenges for ecology and conservation science. Governments around the world have established national parks and wildlife reserves to help protect biodiversity, but there are few studies on the long-term consequences of this strategy. We use Kenya as a case study to investigate species richness and other attributes of mammal communities in 6 protected areas over the past century. Museum records from African expeditions that comprehensively sampled mammals from these same areas in the early 1900's provide a baseline for evaluating changes in species richness and community structure over time. We compare species lists assembled from archived specimens (1896–1950) to those of corresponding modern protected areas (1950– 2013). Species richness in Kenya was stable or increased at 5 out of 6 sites from historical to modern times. Beta-diversity, in contrast, decreased across all sites. Potential biases such as variable historical vs. modern collection effort and detection of small-bodied, rare, and low-visibility species do not account for the observed results. We attribute the pattern of decreased beta diversity primarily to increased site occupancy by common species across all body size classes. Despite a decrease in land area available to wildlife, our data do not show the extinctions predicted by species-area relationships. Moreover, the results indicate that species-area curves based solely on protected areas could underestimate diversity because they do not account for mammal species whose ranges extend beyond protected area boundaries. We conclude that the 6 protected areas have been effective in preserving species richness in spite of continuing conversion of wild grasslands to cropland, but the overall decrease in beta diversity indicates a decline in the uniqueness of mammal communities that historically characterized Kenya's varied landscape.},

We present evidence that species interactions may be a significant factor in mediating the regional assembly of the Danish avifauna. Because >95% of breeding species (n = 197) are migratory, we hypothesized that dispersal limitation would not be important and that breeding distributions would largely reflect resource availability and autecological habitat preferences. Instead,wedetected a striking pattern of spatial segregation between ecologically similar species at two spatial scales with a suite of null models that factored in the spatial distribution of habitats in Denmark as well as population size and biomass of each species. Habitat utilization analyses indicated that community-wide patterns of spatial segregation could not be attributed to the patchy distribution of habitat or to gross differences in habitat utilization among ecologically similar species. We hypothesize that, when habitat patch size is limited, conspecific attraction in concert with interspecific territoriality may result in spatially segregated distributions of ecologically similar species at larger spatial scales. In the Danish avifauna, the effects of species interactions on community assembly appear pervasive and can be discerned at grain sizes up to four orders of magnitude larger than those of individual territories. These results suggest that species interactions should be incorporated into species distribution modeling algorithms designed to predict species occupancy patterns based on environmental variables.},

abstract = {Coexistence between plant species is well known to depend on the outcomes of species interactions within an environmental context. The incorporation of environmental variation into empirical studies of coexistence are rare, however, due to the complex experiments needed to do so and the lack of feasible modelling approaches for determining how environmental factors alter specific coexistence mechanisms. In this article, we present a simple modelling framework for assessing how variation in species interactions across environmental gradients impact on niche overlap and fitness differences, two core determinants of coexistence. We use a novel formulation of an annual plant population dynamics model that allows for competitive and facilitative species interactions and for variation in the strength and direction of these interactions across environmental gradients. Using this framework, we examine outcomes of plant–plant interactions between four commonly co-occurring annual plant species from Western Australian woodlands. We then determine how niche overlap and fitness differences between these species vary across three environmental gradients previously identified as important for structuring diversity patterns in this system: soil phosphorus, shade and water. We found facilitation to be a widespread phenomenon and that interactions between most species pairs shift between competitive and facilitative across multiple environmental gradients. Environmental conditions also altered the strength, direction and relative variation of both niche overlap and fitness differences in nonlinear and unpredictable ways. Synthesis. We provide a simple framework for incorporating environmental heterogeneity into explorations of coexistence mechanisms. Our findings highlight the importance of the environment in determining the outcome of species interactions and the potential for pairwise coexistence between species. The prevalence of facilitation in our system indicates a need to improve current theoretical frameworks of coexistence to include noncompetitive interactions and ways of translating these effects into explicit predictions of coexistence. Our study also suggests a need for further research into determining which factors result in consistent responses of niche overlap and fitness differences to environmental variation. Such information will improve our ability to predict outcomes of coexistence, invasion events and responses of whole communities to future environmental change.},

abstract = {Modern coexistence theory is increasingly used to explain how differences between competing species lead to coexistence versus competitive exclusion. Although research testing this theory has focused on deterministic cases of competitive exclusion, in which the same species always wins, mounting evidence suggests that competitive exclusion is often historically contingent, such that whichever species happens to arrive first excludes the other. Coexistence theory predicts that historically contingent exclusion, known as priority effects, will occur when large destabilizing differences (positive frequency-dependent growth rates of competitors), combined with small fitness differences (differences in competitors' intrinsic growth rates and sensitivity to competition), create conditions under which neither species can invade an established population of its competitor. Here we extend the empirical application of modern coexistence theory to determine the conditions that promote priority effects. We conducted pairwise invasion tests with four strains of nectar-colonizing yeasts to determine how the destabilizing and fitness differences that drive priority effects are altered by two abiotic factors characterizing the nectar environment: Sugar concentration and pH. We found that higher sugar concentrations increased the likelihood of priority effects by reducing fitness differences between competing species. In contrast, higher pH did not change the likelihood of priority effects, but instead made competition more neutral by bringing both fitness differences and destabilizing differences closer to zero. This study demonstrates how the empirical partitioning of priority effects into fitness and destabilizing components can elucidate the pathways through which environmental conditions shape competitive interactions.},

biodiversity loss is poorly understood. Here, we analyse 100 time-series from biomes across the
Earth to ask how diversity within assemblages is changing through time. We quantified patterns
of temporal $\alpha$ diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal $\beta$ diversity,
measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we do not detect
systematic loss of $\alpha$ diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through
time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change,
species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the
different patterns of temporal $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity. Monitoring and understanding change in species
composition should be a conservation priority.},

@article{Connor2013,
abstract = {To address the idea that the process of interspecific competition can be inferred from data on geographical distribution alone and that evidence from geographical distribution implies an important role for interspecific competition in shaping ecological communities, we reexamine the occurrence of ‘‘true checkerboard'' distributions among the land and freshwater birds in three Melanesian archipelagoes: Vanuatu, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Islands. We use the most recently published distributional records and explicitly include the geography of the distributions of species within each archipelago. We use the overlap of convex hulls to estimate the overlap in the geographic range for each pair of species in each of these archipelagoes. We define a ‘‘true checkerboard'' to consist of a pair of species with exclusive island-by-island distributions, but that have overlapping geographical ranges. To avoid the ‘‘dilution effect,'' we follow Diamond and Gilpin in focusing only on congeneric and within-guild species pairs as potential competitors. Few, if any, ‘‘true checkerboards'' exist in these archipelagoes that could possibly have been influenced by competitive interactions, and even ‘‘true checkerboards'' can arise for reasons other than interspecific competition. The similarity between related species pairs (congeneric and within-guild pairs) and unrelated species pairs in their deviation from expectation of the number of islands shared and the overlap of their geographic ranges indicates that these are not distinct statistical populations, but rather a single population of species pairs. Our result, which is based on an examination of the distributional data alone, is consistent with the interpretation that, in these avifaunas, the distributions of congeneric, within-guild, and unrelated species pairs are shaped by a common set of biological and physical environmental processes.

abstract = {Aim: To test whether congeneric species are significantly associated with one another in space, either positively or negatively. Also, to provide a framework for a causal investigation of co-occurrence patterns by a parallel comparison of interactions in geographical and ecological data matrices. Location: For the analysis of congeneric species' co-occurrences we used 30 matrices covering a wide range of taxa and geographical areas, while for the causal investigation we used the distribution of 50 terrestrial isopod species on 20 islands and 264 sampling stations in the central Aegean archipelago, as well as a number of ecological variables for each sampling station. Methods: We developed a software program (cooc) that incorporates the species-by-species approach to co-occurrence analysis using EcoSim's output of prior null model analysis of co-occurrence. We describe this program in detail, and use it to investigate one of the most common assembly rules, namely, the decreased levels of co-occurrence among congeneric species pairs. For the causal analysis, we proceed likewise, cross-checking the results from the geographical and the ecological matrices. There is only one possible combination of results that can support claims for direct competition among species. Results: We do not get any strong evidence for widespread competition among congeneric species, while most communities investigated do not show significant patterns of species associations. The causal analysis suggests that the principal factors behind terrestrial isopod species associations are of historical nature. Some exceptional cases are also discussed. Main conclusions: Presence/absence data for a variety of taxa do not support the assembly rule that congeneric species are under more intense competition compared to less related species. Also, these same data do not suggest strong interactions among species pairs, regardless of taxonomic status. When significant species associations can be seen in such matrices, they mainly reflect the effects of history or of habitat requirements. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Diamond1982,
abstract = {Among birds of the Bismarck Archipelago, only certain combinations of the species in a guild coexist on islands, and some species that are very similar ecologically have mutually exclusive distributions. Diamond (1975) interpreted these patterns as biologically significant, involving effects such as competition. Connor and Simberloff (1979) claimed such patterns to be not recognizably different from random, because they were scarcely distinguishable from those generated by a "null" distribution supposedly not incorporating competition. On examining the analysis by Connor and Simberloff, we find that it actually yields the opposite conclusion: three faunas tested have grossly non-random structures, while their test is unworkable for the fourth fauna. The method of Connor and Simberloff for generating a null distribution has many fatal weaknesses: dilution of relevant data from guilds with irrelevant data from the whole species pool ; hidden incorporation of effects of competition into the constraints; inability to recognize a checkerboard, the extreme example of a distribution produced by competition; reliance on inefficient Monte Carlo simulations; severe constraints that sometimes make generation of a null distribution impossible; failure to weight species combinations; and failure to identify the direction of non-randomness or the species combinations most responsible. Finally, we use other recent studies by Simberloff and colleagues to examine the value of constructing null hypotheses in community ecology.},

@article{Alroy2019,
abstract = {Aim: The aim was to quantify gradients in local richness levels, feeding strategies and body mass distributions in bats and relate them to environmental variation and habitat disturbance. Location: The New World. Time period: Present day. Major taxa studied: Bats. Methods: I assembled 152 local species inventories from the published literature, which include 245 species, along with body mass measurements and dietary categorizations. I quantified species richness using the Chao 1 extrapolator, obtained mean mass values for the inventories and computed proportions of species and of individuals belonging to different feeding guilds. I reduced the dimensonality of environmental variables using factor analysis and regressed richness values upon the factor scores. Results: South of the Tropic of Cancer, bats exhibit sharp increases in local diversity, the abundance of frugivores and nectarivores, and mean body mass. These offsets are driven by increases in the richness and abundance of the leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae). Richness steeply declines near the Tropic of Capricorn, but the other variables do not trend strongly at this point. Most of the variance is explained by mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality and precipitation. There is no direct evidence that richness is lower in disturbed landscapes. Main conclusions: The great radiation of phyllostomids in the Neotropics has created a uniquely rich biota. The reason that phyllostomids are now absent from the northern temperate zone might be that they are mostly frugivores or nectarivores. Therefore, they have prospered only in regions that provide fruit and nectar year-round. Thus, biotic interactions might be the immediate cause of the latitudinal diversity gradient in New World bats. If so, then the biogeographical break is driven by environmental factors and is not a historical artefact. These results suggest that a more nuanced consideration of latitudinal gradients will prove to be helpful when it comes to studying many taxonomic groups.},

@article{Kennedy2014,
abstract = {Aim: One prominent explanation for the latitudinal gradient in biodiversity proposes that its prime cause is the greater age and/or higher origination rates of tropical clades, and the infrequent or delayed dispersal of their component species into temperate regions. An alternative is that species' carrying capacities vary regionally, which influences rates of time-averaged diversification via ecological opportunity. We contrast these hypotheses, in order to assess potential historical influences upon the latitudinal gradient of New World passerine birds (order Passeriformes), comparing patterns among the two suborders present (oscines and suboscines), which are known to have had different routes of dispersal across the region. Location: New World. Methods: We examine diversity patterns, their abiotic and biotic correlates, and the distributions of phylogenetically old and young species. Results: Strong latitudinal gradients are present within both oscine and suboscine birds, with maximum diversity towards the equator, but their overall shapes differ. Among the oscines, older lineages are found towards the north, with progressively younger lineages present further south. Regional variation in oscine richness is statistically well explained by a combination of productivity and elevation (R2 = 0.76). In contrast, few suboscine groups have colonized the north, so their current diversity is well correlated with temperature seasonality (R2 = 0.74). Main conclusions: Because the oscines colonized the Americas from the north, their latitudinal gradient must reflect regional differences in time-averaged diversification rates, and not the time present within a region. The richness patterns derived from phylogenetic data and the strong predictive power of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) suggest that the radiation of the oscines is consistent with the idea that entry into a new region stimulates a burst of diversification, which is higher and/or continues for longer in areas with greater carrying capacity. Conversely, the suboscine distributions potentially reflect a large historical barrier to dispersal and niche conservatism of climatic tolerances, possibly coupled with competition from the oscines. Although contemporary conditions can explain much of the passerine diversity patterns, history has had an important influence on the taxonomic composition of this gradient. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

@article{Cardinale2012,
abstract = {Two decades ago the first Earth Summit raised the question of how biological diversity loss alters ecosystem functioning and affects humanity; this Review looks at the progress made towards answering this question. The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, stimulated an explosion of research into how biodiversity loss influences the processes that underpin the goods and services that ecosystems provide to humanity. That research has established that biodiversity is crucial for ecosystem function, but just how the relationship works has been a source of controversy. This Review considers recent advances that are beginning to explain how biological diversity influences the functioning of ecosystems, and the provision of specific ecosystem services. The authors conclude that, together with management strategies such as payment for ecosystem services, the next generation of biodiversity science has the potential to bring the modern era of biodiversity loss to an end and to maintain a satisfactory level of ecosystem services. The most unique feature of Earth is the existence of life, and the most extraordinary feature of life is its diversity. Approximately 9 million types of plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people. Two decades ago, at the first Earth Summit, the vast majority of the world's nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth's ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate. This observation led to the question of how such loss of biological diversity will alter the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide society with the goods and services needed to prosper.},
