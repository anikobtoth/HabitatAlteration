abstract = {Expansion of the cattle and soy industries in the Amazon basin has increased deforestation rates and will soon push all-weather highways into the region's core1-4. In the face of this growing pressure, a comprehensive conservation strategy for the Amazon basin should protect its watersheds, the full range of species and ecosystem diversity, and the stability of regional climates. Here we report that protected areas in the Amazon basin - the central feature of prevailing conservation approaches5-8 - are an important but insufficient component of this strategy, based on policy-sensitive simulations of future deforestation. By 2050, current trends in agricultural expansion will eliminate a total of 40{\%} of Amazon forests, including at least two-thirds of the forest cover of six major watersheds and 12 ecoregions, releasing 32 ± 8 Pg of carbon to the atmosphere. One-quarter of the 382 mammalian species examined will lose more than 40{\%} of the forest within their Amazon ranges. Although an expanded and enforced network of protected areas could avoid as much as one-third of this projected forest loss, conservation on private lands is also essential. Expanding market pressures for sound land management and prevention of forest clearing on lands unsuitable for agriculture are critical ingredients of a strategy for comprehensive conservation3,4. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The late Quaternary megafauna extinction was a severe global-scale event. Two factors, climate change and modern humans, have received broad support as the primary drivers, but their absolute and relative importance remains controversial. To date, focus has been on the extinction chronology of individual or small groups of species, specific geographical regions or macroscale studies at very coarse geographical and taxonomic resolution, limiting the possibility of adequately testing the proposed hypotheses. We present, to our knowledge, the first global analysis of this extinction based on comprehensive country-level data on the geographical distribution of all large mammal species (more than or equal to 10 kg) that have gone globally or continentally extinct between the beginning of the Last Interglacial at 132 000 years BP and the late Holocene 1000 years BP, testing the relative roles played by glacial-interglacial climate change and humans. We show that the severity of extinction is strongly tied to hominin palaeobiogeography, with at most a weak, Eurasia-specific link to climate change. This first species-level macroscale analysis at relatively high geographical resolution provides strong support for modern humans as the primary driver of the worldwide megafauna losses during the late Quaternary. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {1. Pollination interactions comprise a network of connections between flowers and insect visitors. They are crucial for reproductive success in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agri cultural practices. Although less intensive approaches, including organic farming, could improve farmland biodiversity, it is not clear whether or not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination and the stability of insect-flower interaction networks. 2. We investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming on insect-flower interaction net work size and structure, bee and hoverfly diversity, and pollination in 10 pairs of organic and con ventional dairy farms in the Republic of Ireland. 3. We found that insect-flower interaction networks on organic farms were larger and more asym metrically structured than networks on conventional farms. Overall, however, networks contained fewer taxa and niche overlap and plant/animal ratios were relatively low compared with previously documented insect-flower interaction networks. Organic farms did attract higher numbers of bees partly because of higher floral abundances (mainly Trifolium sp.). Hoverfly evenness was greater in organic farms but neither abundance, richness nor evenness was related to floral abundance, sug gesting organic farms provide additional resources for hoverflies. Pollination of Crataegus monog yna hawthorn was higher on organic farms, although pollen deposition was limited. 4. Synthesis and applications. Organic dairy farming can increase the size and alter the structure of insect-flower interaction networks. However, network stability was not improved and all networks (organic and conventional) were vulnerable because of their small size, low niche overlap and low plant/animal ratios. Nonetheless, organic farming provided more flowers that attracted more flower visitors and improved pollination of C. monogyna. We suggest that strategic management of important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be endorsed in agri-environ mental schemes. Sowing Trifolium spp., and allowing these plants to flower, could benefit bees, but more research into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation recommendations can be made for this group. We conclude that organic farming, although not the solution in its present form, can benefit insect biodiversity, insect-flower interaction networks and insect-mediated polli nation.},

Such correlations can result from ecologically relevant processes, such as existence and evolution of species communities. Correlations are typically quantified by some sort of similarity index based on co-occurrence counts. We argue that the individual values of a similarity index are not useful as such: rather, we have to be able to estimate the statistical significance of the index value. Secondly, we argue that before computing the correlations one has to carefully select what is the underlying base set of locations for which the co-occurrence counts, similarity indices, and their significance is computed. We demonstrate base set selection with synthetic examples and conclude with an analysis of real data from a large database of fossil land mammals.},

abstract = {Agricultural transformation represents one of the greatest threats to biodiversity, causing degradation and loss of habitat, leading to changes in the richness and composition of communities. These changes in richness and composition may, in turn, lead to altered species co-occurrence, but our knowledge of this remains limited. We used a novel co-occurrence network approach to examine the impact of agricultural transformation on reptile community structure within two large ({\textgreater} 172 000 km2; 224 sites) agricultural regions in southeastern Australia. We contrasted assemblages from sites surrounded by intact and modified landscapes and tested four key hypotheses that agricultural transformation leads to (H1) declines in species richness, (H2) altered assemblages, (H3) declines in overall co-occurrence, and (H4) complex restructuring of pairwise associations. We found that modified landscapes differed in composition but not richness compared with intact sites. Modified landscapes were also characterized by differences in co-occurrence network structure; with species sharing fewer sites with each other (reduced co-occurrence connectance), fewer highly-connected species (truncation of the frequency distribution of co-occurrence degree) and increased modularity of co-occurrence networks. Critically, overall loss of co-occurrence was underpinned by complex changes to the number and distribution of pair-wise co-occurrence links, with 41–44{\%} of species also gaining associations with other species. Change in co-occurrence was not correlated with changes in occupancy, nor by functional trait membership, allowing a novel classification of species susceptibility to agricultural transformation. Our study reveals the value of using co-occurrence analysis to uncover impacts of agricultural transformation that may be masked in conventional studies of species richness and community composition.},

abstract = {Two species of Andean brush-finches, Buarremon (formerly Atlapetes) torquatus and B. brunneinuchu{\$}, show an interdigitating pattern of distribution in the Andes that we interpret as the result of competition between them. Plotting 590 specimen localities by latitude and elevation reveals that the two species have complementary, parapatric distributions with minimal overlap. More importantly, where only one species occurs, that species usually occupies the entire elevational range in that region. Furthermore, the usual relative position of the two species, with B. torquatus at high and B. brunneinuchus at low elevations, is reversed in two regions. These "natural experiments" suggest that elevational limits are unlikely to be governed in these two species by autecological factors and that interspecific competition is the process most likely to generate such a pattern. However, our re-evaluation of other data interpreted to support the prevalence of interspecific competition in determining elevational limits of other Andean birds suggests that its role has not been properly resolved. BIRD DISTRIBUTIONS in the Andes Mountains are characterized by vertical segregation and relatively uniform elevational ranges throughout the range of each species (Chapman 1917, 1926). One striking exception to this generalization is the elevational distribution of Buar-remon (formerly Atlapetes; see below) torquatus (Stripe-headed Brush-Finch; Emberizinae), which in some areas occurs from near timber-line to the lower limit of cloud forest, but in other areas has a narrow elevational distribution (Paynter 1978, Hilty and Brown 1986, Fjeld-sl and Krabbe 1990). Paynter (1978) and Fjelds• and Krabbe (1990) proposed that the areas where B. torquatus occupied narrow elevational ranges corresponded to those areas where a congener, B. brunneinu-chus (Chestnut-capped Brush-Finch), was present , suggesting that interspecific competition governed elevational limits in these two species. Their similarity in body size, shape, plum-age, foraging behavior (mainly terrestrial), and habitat (undergrowth of humid montane forest) makes these brush-finches likely competitors. The purpose of our analysis was to evaluate this hypothesis by plotting precisely the latitudinal and elevational distributions of the two species, and then comparing the distribution of B. tor-quatus in areas with and without B. brunneinu-chus. The interspecific competition hypothesis predicts that the two distributions should be complementary, with perhaps minimal sym-patty where ranges abut and, more importantly, that one species should expand its range of elevations where the other is absent. Other hypotheses , such as the autecological hypothesis or the historical-accident hypothesis (Remsen and Cardiff 1990), predict that the distributions of the two species should be independent of one another within the same habitat, climato-logical, or zoogeographic region, and that ele-vational limits of one species should not change where the other is missing. Although Paynter (1978) previously mapped latitudinal distributions of Buarremon brush-finches from collecting localities, he was unable to analyze elevational distributions in a similar way because of the absence of elevational data from many collecting localities. However, with the recent completion of the gazetteers for all the Andean countries by Paynter and his colleagues (Paynter et al. 1975, Paynter and Traylot 1977, 1981, Paynter 1982, 1985, Stephens and Traylot 1983), mapping of elevational distributions is now feasible. Furthermore, 15 years of additional fieldwork since Paynter's analysis (1978) has generated much additional locality data, particularly in Peru and Bolivia.

To study this, we examined species richness and an ecosystem function, cellulose decomposition, while environmental conditions were held constant. Our hypotheses were (1) increasing species richness will have no effect on rates of cellulose decomposition and (2) species richness will decline over time in functionally redundant communities. A relatively simple microcosm‐based system to manipulate complex microbial interactions was employed. Microcosms containing cellulose as the sole carbon source were inoculated at equal densities with none, one, two, four, or eight species of cellulolytic bacteria. At 5‐d intervals for 25 d, community composition and cellulose decomposition were determined. We rejected both of our hypotheses. In a constant environment, greater species richness supported a greater number of individuals and subsequently greater rates of total cellulose decomposition. Furthermore, greater initial species richness maintained greater richness over time. These results provide experimental evidence that functionally redundant species may play an integral role in ecosystem function.},

abstract = {Currently, 43{\%} of the world's terrestrial surface is within five kilometres of a road, and therefore understanding how road networks impact species and ecosystem processes is highly relevant to applied conservation ecology. Among various effects on wildlife, roads can disrupt the interaction between plants and their animal-mediated seed dispersers, compromising plant community composition and regeneration. Here, using the Chinese beech (Fagus engleriana) nut-rodent system, we quantified the extent to which rodent functions on seed dispersal were modified in habitats adjacent to roads. Compared to transects 200 m from the road, we observed approximately nine times greater seed dispersal effectiveness at transects 10 m proximity to the road and six times greater at 100 m from the road. Associated with this, high densities of seedlings, saplings and mature trees occurred closer to the road, suggesting that the road effect zone may facilitate plant recruitment. However, road proximity resulted in shorter nut dispersal distances, which did not support a benefit to plant recruitment. These counteractive effects may be caused by modified rodent behaviour in the vicinity of the road, and also by effects on rodent distribution and activity in relation to road-side habitat structure and environmental pressure. Crucially, no tagged seeds were dispersed across the road, implying that it imposed a barrier effect on animal-mediated seed dispersal and plant recruitment. We conclude that the ever-expanding effect of roads on zoochorous seed dispersal may ultimately cause profound changes in the structure of plant communities across diverse ecosystems, on a global scale.},

These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks.

abstract = {Aim: Climate change and an increase in human disturbance are major drivers of global biodiversity loss. Yet it is not clear to what extent their effects on animal communities are direct or indirectly mediated by changes in biotic factors, such as plant diversity. Here, we disentangle the direct and indirect effects of climate, human disturbance, vegetation structure and plant functional traits on the functional diversity of avian frugivore communities across a large environmental gradient. Location: Mount Kilimanjaro. Time period: Sampling between November 2013 and October 2015. Major taxa studied: Fleshy-fruited plants, frugivorous birds. Methods: We sampled plant and bird communities along an elevational and a human disturbance gradient and measured corresponding morphological traits of plants and birds to calculate indices of functional identity and functional diversity of plant and bird communities. We used structural equation models to disentangle direct and indirect effects of all variables on functional identity and diversity of frugivorous bird communities. Results: Both functional identity and diversity of frugivorous bird communities were consistently related to the functional identity and diversity of plant communities. Climate had almost exclusively indirect effects on functional identity and diversity of bird communities mediated through effects on plant functional identity and diversity. In contrast, human disturbance also had direct negative effects on bird diversity. Main conclusions: We show that plant functional identity and diversity are the most important drivers of functional identity and diversity of frugivorous birds. Although effects of climate on bird communities are almost exclusively mediated indirectly through plant communities, human disturbance resulted in a direct reduction of bird diversity. The high degree of trait matching between interdependent trophic levels over a large environmental gradient demonstrates the importance of biotic drivers for animal communities and shows that biodiversity models need to consider such bottom-up effects in future conditions.},

abstract = {The study of species co-occurrences has been central in community ecology since the foundation of the discipline. Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate hypotheses for differ-ent community assembly mechanisms, and to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association decreases with the num-ber of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species inter-actions from co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distri-butions models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.},

abstract = {Just as long-term nitrogen loading of grasslands decreases plant species richness and increases plant biomass, we have found that nitrogen loading decreases insect species richness and increases insect abundances. We sampled 54 plots that had been maintained at various rates of nitrogen addition for 14 years. Total insect species richness and effective insect diversity, as well as herbivore and predator species richness, were significantly, negatively related to the rate of nitrogen addition. However, there was variation in trophic responses to nitrogen. Detritivore species richness increased as nitrogen addition increased, and parasitoids showed no response. Insect abundances, measured as the number of insects and insect biovolume (an estimate of biomass), were significantly, positively related to the rate of nitrogen addition, as were the abundances of herbivores and detritivores. Parasitoid abundance was negatively related to the rate of nitrogen addition. Changes in the insect community were correlated with changes in the plant community. As rates of nitrogen addition increased, plant species richness decreased, plant productivity and plant tissue nitrogen increased, and plant composition shifted from C4 to C3 grass species. Along this gradient, total insect species richness and effective insect diversity were most strongly, positively correlated with plant species richness. Insect biovolume was negatively correlated with plant species richness. Responses of individual herbivores varied along the nitrogen gradient, but numbers of 13 of the 18 most abundant herbivores were positively correlated with their host plant biomass. Although insect communities did not respond as strongly asplant communities, insect species richness, abundance, and composition were impacted by nitrogen addition. This study demonstrates that long-term nitrogen loading affects the entire food chain, simplifying both plant and insect communities.},

abstract = {Agricultural land use results in direct biodiversity decline through loss of natural habitat, but may also cause indirect cross-habitat effects on conservation areas. We conducted three landscape-scale field studies on 67 sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) results in a transient dilution of bees in crop fields, and in increased competition between crop plants and grassland plants for pollinators. Abundances of bumble-bees, which are the main pollinators of the grassland plant Primula veris, but also pollinate oilseed rape (OSR), decreased with increasing amount of OSR. This landscape-scale dilution affected bumble-bee abundances strongly in OSR fields and marginally in grasslands, where bumble-bee abundances were generally low at the time of Primula flowering. Seed set of Primula veris, which flowers during OSR bloom, was reduced by 20 per cent when the amount of OSR within 1 km radius increased from 0 to 15 per cent. Hence, the current expansion of bee-attractive biofuel crops results in transient dilution of crop pollinators, which means an increased competition for pollinators between crops and wild plants. In conclusion, mass-flowering crops potentially threaten fitness of concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas, despite the fact that, in the long run, mass-flowering crops can enhance abundances of generalist pollinators and their pollination service. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

It has been thought that long-term changes in the dominance of major taxonomic groups can be predicted from these characteristics. However, new analyses show that diversity limits may rise or fall in response to adaptive radiations or extinctions. These changes are idiosyncratic and occur at different times in each taxa. For example, the end-Permian mass extinction permanently reduced the diversity of important, previously dominant groups such as brachiopods and crinoids. The current global crisis may therefore permanently alter the biosphere's taxonomic composition by changing the rules of evolution.},

abstract = {The current massive degradation of habitat and extinction of species is taking place on a catastrophically short timescale, and their effects will fundamentally reset the future evolution of the planet's biota. The fossil record suggests that recovery of global ecosystems has required millions or even tens of millions of years. Thus, intervention by humans, the very agents of the current environmental crisis, is required for any possibility of short-term recovery or maintenance of the biota. Many current recovery efforts have deficiencies, including insufficient information on the diversity and distribution of species, ecological processes, and magnitude and interaction of threats to biodiversity (pollution, overharvesting, climate change, disruption of biogeochemical cycles, introduced or invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation through land use, disruption of community structure in habitats, and others). A much greater and more urgently applied investment to address these deficiencies is obviously warranted. Conservation and restoration in human-dominated ecosystems must strengthen connections between human activities, such as agricultural or harvesting practices, and relevant research generated in the biological, earth, and atmospheric sciences. Certain threats to biodiversity require intensive international cooperation and input from the scientific community to mitigate their harmful effects, including climate change and alteration of global biogeochemical cycles. In a world already transformed by human activity, the connection between humans and the ecosystems they depend on must frame any strategy for the recovery of the biota.},

abstract = {Urbanization alters ecosystems worldwide, but little is known about its effects in the Neotropical region. In the present research we examined the relative influence of different levels of urbanization and of some urban development measures on bird species richness, abundance and composition. We surveyed 104 observation stations at which we collected data on the relative abundance of bird species, and also data on seven environmental variables as measures of urban development and human activity. We registered 57 native bird species. Bird species richness and bird abundance increased with lower urbanization levels. Both variables were positively related to vegetation cover and native vegetation, and negatively to built-up cover, abundance of Rock Pigeon (Columa livia), pedestrian rate and car rate. A canonical correspondence analysis produced a significant model that explained 37{\%} of the total variation in species data. This analysis segregated bird species along two important gradients: urbanization and elevation. The most urbanized areas were dominated by a few synanthropic species tolerant to human disturbance, such as Rufous-Collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata) or Chiguanco Thrush (Turdus chiguanco). Areas with lower urbanization levels had more species typically associated with native vegetation, such as Plain-Mantled Tit-Spinetail (Leptasthenura aegitaloides)orD'Orbigny's Chat-Tyrant (Ochthoeca oenanthoides), among others. Elevation had a significant influence in structuring bird communities, with some species restricted to higher elevations and some to lower elevations. Although changes in elevation had an important influence, urbanization had a stronger effect on structuring bird communities. This study provides valuable information and an important baseline for future studies.},

abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation often reduce gene flow and genetic diversity in plants by disrupting the movement of pollen and seed. However, direct comparisons of the contributions of pollen vs. seed dispersal to genetic variation in fragmented landscapes are lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we partitioned the genetic diversity contributed by male gametes from pollen sources and female gametes from seed sources within established seedlings of the palm Oenocarpus bataua in forest fragments and continuous forest in northwest Ecuador. This approach allowed us to quantify the separate contributions of each of these two dispersal processes to genetic variation. Compared to continuous forest, fragments had stronger spatial genetic structure, especially among female gametes, and reduced effective population sizes. We found that within and among fragments, allelic diversity was lower and genetic structure higher for female gametes than for male gametes. Moreover, female gametic allelic diversity in fragments decreased with decreasing surrounding forest cover, while male gametic allelic diversity did not. These results indicate that limited seed dispersal within and among fragments restricts genetic diversity and strengthens genetic structure in this system. Although pollen movement may also be impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation, it nonetheless serves to promote gene flow and diversity within and among fragments. Pollen and seed dispersal play distinctive roles in determining patterns of genetic variation in fragmented landscapes, and maintaining the integrity of both dispersal processes will be critical to managing and conserving genetic variation in the face of continuing habitat loss and fragmentation in tropical landscapes.},

abstract = {The Earth's ecosystems are under unprecedented pressure, yet the nature of contemporary biodiversity change is not well understood. Growing evidence that community size is regulated highlights the need for improved understanding of community dynamics. As stability in community size could be underpinned by marked temporal turnover, a key question is the extent to which changes in both biodiversity dimensions (temporal $\alpha$- and temporal $\beta$-diversity) covary within and among the assemblages that comprise natural communities. Here, we draw on a multiassemblage dataset (encompassing vertebrates, invertebrates, and unicellular plants) from a tropical freshwater ecosystem and employ a cyclic shift randomization to assess whether any directional change in temporal $\alpha$-diversity and temporal $\beta$-diversity exceeds baseline levels. In the majority of cases, $\alpha$-diversity remains stable over the 5-y time frame of our analysis, with little evidence for systematic change at the community level. In contrast, temporal $\beta$-diversity changes are more prevalent, and the two diversity dimensions are decoupled at both the within- and among-assemblage level. Consequently, a pressing research challenge is to establish how turnover supports regulation and when elevated temporal $\beta$-diversity jeopardizes community integrity.},

abstract = {The end of the Pleistocene was marked by the extinction of almost all large land mammals worldwide except in Africa. Although the debate on Pleisto-cene extinctions has focused on the roles of climate change and humans, the impact of perturbations depends on properties of ecological communities, such as species composition and the organization of ecological interactions. Here, we combined palaeoecological and ecological data, food-web models and community stability analysis to investigate if differences between Pleis-tocene and modern mammalian assemblages help us understand why the megafauna died out in the Americas while persisting in Africa. We show Pleistocene and modern assemblages share similar network topology, but differences in richness and body size distributions made Pleistocene commu-nities significantly more vulnerable to the effects of human arrival. The structural changes promoted by humans in Pleistocene networks would have increased the likelihood of unstable dynamics, which may favour extinction cascades in communities facing extrinsic perturbations. Our find-ings suggest that the basic aspects of the organization of ecological communities may have played an important role in major extinction events in the past. Knowledge of community-level properties and their consequences to dynamics may be critical to understand past and future extinctions.},
annote = {Only paper I know of that really employs a network approach on paleontological large mammals. The authors create a food web of pleistocene megafauna (methods are a bit debatable, there is a lot of indirect evidence and inference of links using body size). They then investigate the effects of losing large megafauna on the network structure and the effects of a new predator (humans). They focus on nestedness and modularity. Their work apparently implies that the arrival of humans resulted in a more fragile network structure than before. Broader implications are that community level properties may play a role in extinction risk and the resilience of species. 

Thoughts: on first read this paper seemed a bit contrived to me, because the networks were inferred, not built with observational data (such as stomach contents). Body size of predators was used to estimate which prey species might be consumed. This seems a bit simplistic to me. But they did use previously published network models which presumably makes the analysis acceptable. Tests showed that about 70{\%} of modern predator-prey interactions are predicted accurately, meaning if similar rules apply (likely) then the paleo food webs are about 70{\%} accurate on average, so some are worse. From what I know about networks, the error in the network models could produce network results that are not reliable in the rest of the study.

This approach also does not take into account prey specialization in large predators and hypercarnivory... 

I found that the authors were not clear on how their measurements of mod and nest translate to their claims about network topology; it seems these claim are mosty based on comparing effects. They say that nestedness may translate to less stability. 

Modern and pleistocene networks apparently had similar structures, but pleistocene assemblages were more sensitive to human arrival, allegedly because of their predator to prey species richness (not topology).},

abstract = {The extent to which resource subsidies affect food web dynamics is poorly understood in anthropogenic landscapes. To better understand how species interactions are influenced by subsidies, we studied breeding birds and nest predators along a rural-to-urban landscape gradient that varied in subsidies provided to generalist predators. We hypothesized that resource subsidies in urban landscapes would decouple predator-prey relationships, as predators switch from natural to anthropogenic foods. From 2004 to 2009, we surveyed nest predators and monitored 2942 nests of five songbird species breeding in 19 mature forest stands in Ohio, USA. Eighteen species were video-recorded depredating nests. Numbers of avian and mammalian nest predators were positively associated with the amount of urban development surrounding forests, with the exception of Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater). Although nest survival strongly declined with detections of nest predators in rural landscapes, nest survival and predator numbers were unrelated in urban landscapes. Thus, the strength of interaction between breeding birds and nest predators diminished as landscapes surrounding forested parks became more urbanized. Our work suggests that decoupling of predator-prey relationships can arise when synanthropic predators are heavily subsidized by anthropogenic resources. In this way, human drivers can alter, and completely disarticulate, relationships among species that are well established in more natural systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Throughout evolution the foraging and echolocation behaviors as well as the motor systems of bats have been adapted to the tasks they have to perform while searching and acquiring food. When bats exploit the same class of environmental resources in a similar way, they perform comparable tasks and thus share similar adaptations independent of their phylogeny. Species with similar adaptations are assigned to guilds or functional groups. Habitat type and foraging mode mainly determine the foraging tasks and thus the adaptations of bats. Therefore we use habitat type and foraging mode to define seven guilds. The habitat types open, edge and narrow space are defined according to the bats' echolocation behavior in relation to the distance between bat and background or food item and background. Bats foraging in the aerial, trawling, flutter detecting, or active gleaning mode use only echolocation to acquire their food. When foraging in the passive gleaning mode bats do not use echolocation but rely on sensory cues from the food item to find it. Bat communities often comprise large numbers of species with a high diversity in foraging areas, foraging modes, and diets. The assignment of species living under similar constraints into guilds identifies pattern of community structure and helps to understand the factors that underlie the organization of highly diverse bat communities. Bat species from different guilds do not compete for food as they differ in their foraging behavior and in the environmental resources they use. However, sympatric living species belonging to the same guild often exploit the same class of resources. To avoid competition they should differ in their niche dimensions. The fine grain structure of bat communities below the rather coarse classification into guilds is determined by mechanisms that result in niche partitioning.},

abstract = {There is no agreement among palaeobiologists or biologists as towhether, or to what extent, there are limits on diversification and species numbers. Here, we posit that part of the disagreement stems from: (i) the lack of explicit criteria for defining the relevant species pools, which may be defined phylogenetically, ecologically or geographically; (ii) assumptions that must be made when extrapolating from population-level logistic growth to macro-evolutionary diversification; and (iii) too much emphasis being placed on fixed carrying capacities, rather than taking into account the opportunities for increased species richness on evolutionary timescales, for example, owing to increased biologically available energy, increased habitat complexity and the ability of many clades to better extract resources from the environment, or to broaden their resource base. Thus, we argue that a more effective way of assessing the evidence for and against the ideas of bound versus unbound diversification is through appropriate definition of the relevant species pools, and through explicitmodelling of diversity-dependent diversificationwith time-varying carrying capacities. Here,we showthat time-varying carrying capacities, either increases or decreases, can be accommodated through changing intrinsic diversification rates (diversity-independent effects), or changing the effects of crowding (diversity-dependent effects).},

abstract = {Urbanization poses a serious threat to local biodiversity, yet towns and cities with abundant natural features may harbor important species populations and communities. While the contribution of urban greenspaces to conservation has been demonstrated by numerous studies within temperate regions, few consider the bird communities associated with different landcovers in Neotropical cities. To begin to fill this knowledge gap, we examined how the avifauna of a wetland city in northern Amazonia varied across six urban landcover types (coastal bluespace; urban bluespace; managed greenspace; unmanaged greenspace; dense urban; and sparse urban). We measured detections, species richness, and a series of ground cover variables that characterized the heterogeneity of each landcover, at 114 locations across the city. We recorded {\textgreater}10{\%} (98) of Guyana's bird species in Georgetown, including taxa of conservation interest. Avian detections, richness, and community composition differed with landcover type. Indicator species analysis identified 29 species from across dietary guilds, which could be driving community composition. Comparing landcovers, species richness was highest in managed greenspaces and lowest in dense urban areas. The canal network had comparable levels of species richness to greenspaces. The waterways are likely to play a key role in enhancing habitat connectivity as they traverse densely urbanized areas. Both species and landcover information should be integrated into urban land-use planning in the rapidly urbanizing Neotropics to maximize the conservation value of cities. This is imperative in the tropics, where anthropogenic pressures on species are growing significantly, and action needs to be taken to prevent biodiversity collapse.},

abstract = {Species interactions are dynamic processes that vary across environmental and ecological contexts, and operate across scale boundaries, making them difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, ecologists are increasingly interested in inferring species interactions from observational data using statistical analyses of their spatial co-occurrence patterns. Trophic interactions present a particular challenge, as predators and prey may frequently or rarely co-occur, depending on the spatial or temporal scale of observation. In this study, we investigate the accuracy of inferred interactions among species that both compete and trophically interact. We utilized a long-term dataset of pond-breeding amphibian co-occurrences from Mt Rainier National Park (Washington, USA) and compiled a new dataset of their empirical interactions from the literature. We compared the accuracy of four statistical methods in inferring these known species interactions from spatial associations. We then used the best performing statistical method, the Markov network, to further investigate the sensitivity of interaction inference to spatial scale-dependence and the presence of predators. We show that co-occurrence methods are generally inaccurate when estimating trophic interactions. Further the strength and sign of inferred interactions were dependent upon the spatial scale of observation and predator presence influenced the detectability of competitive interactions among prey species. However, co-occurrence analysis revealed new patterns of spatial association among pairs of species with known interactions. Overall, our study highlights a limiting frontier in co-occurrence theory and the disconnect between widely implemented methodologies and their ability to accurately infer interactions in trophically-structured communities.},

The results are based on applying a highly accurate method of estimating species richness to 875 ecological samples. About 41{\%} of the tree and animal species in this dataset are absent from disturbed habitats, even though most samples do still represent forests of some kind.

abstract = {Urbanization is a widespread and rapidly growing threat to biodiversity, therefore we need a predictive understanding of its effects on species and ecosystem processes. In this paper we study the impact of urbanization on a guild of nectar-feeding birds in a biodiversity hotspot at the Cape of Africa. The guild of four bird species provides important ecosystem services by pollinating 320 plant species in the Cape Floral Region. Functional diversity within the guild is related to differences in bill length. The long-billed Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa) plays an irreplaceable role as the exclusive pollinator of plant species with long nectar tubes. We analyzed the composition of the guild in suburban gardens of Cape Town along a gradient of increasing distance from the nearest natural habitat. Urbanization reduces the functional diversity of the nectarivore guild. Malachite Sunbirds did not penetrate more than 1 km into the city, whereas only the short-billed Southern Double-collared Sunbirds (Cinnyris chalybea) occurred throughout the urbanization gradient. The lack of data precludes conclusions regarding the detailed responses of Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea) and Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer), however their absence across the entire gradient is suggestive of high sensitivity. The functional diversity of this guild of pollinators can potentially be restored, but the pros and cons of this conservation action need to be considered. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the author(s).},

abstract = {Throughout the last two decades, Bayesian statistical methods have proliferated throughout ecology and evolution. Numerous previous references established both philosophical and computational guidelines for implementing Bayesian methods. However, protocols for incorporating prior information, the defining characteristic of Bayesian philosophy, are nearly nonexistent in the ecological literature. Here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors in ecology and evolution by providing a ‘consumer's guide' to weakly informative priors. The first section outlines three reasons why ecologists should abandon noninformative priors: 1) common flat priors are not always noninformative, 2) noninformative priors provide the same result as simpler frequentist methods, and 3) noninformative priors suffer from the same high type I and type M error rates as frequentist methods. The second section provides a guide for implementing informative priors, wherein I detail convenient ‘reference' prior distributions for common statistical models (i.e. regression, ANOVA, hierarchical models). I then use simulations to visually demonstrate how informative priors influence posterior parameter estimates. With the guidelines provided here, I hope to encourage the use of weakly informative priors for Bayesian analyses in ecology. Ecologists can and should debate the appropriate form of prior information, but should consider weakly informative priors as the new ‘default' prior for any Bayesian model.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions drive key ecological and evolutionary processes and mediate ecosystem responses to climate change. The direction, frequency, and intensity of biotic interactions can in turn be altered by climate change. Understanding the complex interplay between climate and biotic interactions is thus essential for fully anticipating how ecosystems will respond to the fast rates of current warming, which are unprecedented since the end of the last glacial period. We highlight episodes of climate change that have disrupted ecosystems and trophic interactions over time scales ranging from years to millennia by changing species' relative abundances and geographic ranges, causing extinctions, and creating transient and novel communities dominated by generalist species and interactions. These patterns emerge repeatedly across disparate temporal and spatial scales, suggesting the possibility of similar underlying processes. Based on these findings, we identify knowledge gaps and fruitful areas for research that will further our understanding of the effects of climate change on ecosystems. C limate change has occurred repeatedly throughout Earth's history, but the recent rate of warming far exceeds that of any previous warming episode in the past 10,000 years (1, 2) and perhaps far longer. Knowledge of how climate change has altered interactions among organisms in the past may help us understand whether consistent patterns emerge that could inform the future of a warming and increasingly human-dominated planet. The fossil record pro-vides an opportunity to study ecosystems on both ecological and geological time scales but is un-evenly distributed across time, environments, and taxa and contains only fragmentary information about biotic interactions (3). Modern systems provide direct, though short-term, observational (4) and experimental (5, 6) evidence of changes in biotic interactions during climate change that together can elucidate important mechanisms driv-ing ecological and evolutionary processes. How-ever, it is not always clear how to extrapolate the insights gained from short-term observations over the longer time scales on which future climate change will play out. Robust predictions about the future require multispecies models that combine long-term insights from the past with more specific and shorter-term insights from modern systems— a herculean challenge, given that models for spe-cies responses to climate change have only begun to incorporate biotic interactions (7). Even the term " biotic interactions " means different things to different disciplines. We view biotic interactions in broad terms—namely, as the influence of indivi-duals or populations on one another. In practice, observations from the fossil record and models of the future generally consider the potential interac-tions of co-occurring species, whereas actual inter-actions are more easily identified in modern systems. Here we combine insights from past and present-day ecological systems to understand how climate change has affected biotic interactions through time and to identify fruitful avenues for adequate-ly predicting future changes to ecosystems.},

abstract = {Species distribution in a metacommunity varies according to their traits, the distribution of environmental conditions and connectivity among localities. These ingredients contribute to coexistence across spatial scales via species sorting, patch dynamics, mass effects and neutral dynamics. These mechanisms however seldom act in isolation and the impact of landscape configuration on their relative importance remains poorly understood. We present a new model of metacommunity dynamics that simultaneously considers these four possible mechanisms over spatially explicit landscapes and propose a statistical approach to partition their contribution to species distribution. We find that landscape configuration can induce dispersal limitations that have negative consequences for local species richness. This result was more pronounced with neutral dynamics and mass effect than with species sorting or patch dynamics. We also find that the relative importance of the four mechanisms varies not only among landscape configurations, but also among species, with some species being mostly constrained by dispersal and/or drift and others by sorting. Changes in landscape properties might lead to a shift in coexistence mechanisms and, by extension, to a change in community composition. This confirms the importance of considering landscape properties for conservation and management. Our results illustrate the idea that ecological communities are the results of multiple mechanisms acting at the same time and complete our understanding of spatial processes in competitive metacommunities.This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {We assessed the ecomorphological structure of a guild of rhinolophoid bats in a Malaysian rainforest first described by Heller and von Helversen (1989). These authors found that the distribution of echolocation call frequencies used by 12 syntopic species was more even than expected from allometric relationships or in randomly generated communities, and that the observed minimal ratio was greater than expected by chance alone. In this study we were able to expand their guild to 15 species, but in doing so it became apparent that call frequencies might be less evenly distributed across the total frequency range than previously proposed. We rep-licated Heller and von Helversen's (1989) analyses with the full 15-species complement but were unable to support their suggestion that rhinolophoid bats exhibit resource partitioning through differences in frequency bands. We adopted a multivariate approach and incorporated measures of body size and wing morphology into the analysis. We used phylogenetic autocorrelation to ensure that the species were statistically independent and principal component analysis to describe the morphological space occupied by the 15 species in the community and four additional species representing the extremes of phenotypic variation. We derived interspecific Euclidean distances and tested the mean values and SDs of these distances against those of 100 guilds of "synthetic" species created randomly within the principal component space. The guild of Rhinolophoidea was not distributed randomly in multivariate space. Instead we found evidence of morphological overdispersion of the most similar species, which suggests niche differentiation in response to competition. Less similar species were nearer in morphological space than expected, and we suggest this is a consequence of ecological constraints on parameter combinations. Despite this underdispersion, many of the more distant neighbours were evenly rather than randomly spaced or clumped in morphospace, suggesting that, given the environmental constraints on morphology, species in this guild do experience limits to their similarity. Finally, we tested the influence of the relative abundance of species on morphological displacement, and found no evidence that abundant, spatially correlated species reduce interspecific overlap in morphological space.},

The method depicts interactions and associations in an analogous way with existing network diagrams for studying pollination and trophic interactions, but adds the assessment of sign, strength, and direction of the associations. This provides a distinct advantage over existing methods of quantifying and visualizing co-occurrence. We demonstrate the utility of our new approach by showing differences in associations among woodland bird species found in different habitats and by illustrating the way these can be interpreted in terms of underlying ecological mechanisms. Our new method is computationally feasible for large assemblages and provides readily interpretable effects with standard errors. It has wide applications for quantifying species associations within ecological communities, examining questions about particular species that occur with others, and how their associations can determine the structure and composition of communities.},

Here, using the exceptional fossil record of Cenozoic Era macroperforate planktonic foraminifera, we assess the evidence for alternative modes of macroevolutionary competition. Our models support an environmentally dependent macroevolutionary form of contest competition that yields finite upper bounds on species richness. Models of biotic competition assuming unchanging environmental conditions were overwhelmingly rejected. In the best-supported model, temperature affects the per-lineage diversification rate, while both temperature and an environmental driver of sediment accumulation defines the upper limit. The support for contest competition implies that incumbency constrains species richness by restricting niche availability, and that the number of macroevolutionary niches varies as a function of environmental changes.},

abstract = {Understanding how ecological communities are organized and how they change through time is critical to predicting the effects of climate change. Recent work documenting the co-occurrence structure of modern communities found that most significant species pairs co-occur less frequently than would be expected by chance. However, little is known about how co-occurrence structure changes through time. Here we evaluate changes in plant and animal community organization over geological time by quantifying the co-occurrence structure of 359,896 unique taxon pairs in 80 assemblages spanning the past 300 million years. Co-occurrences of most taxon pairs were statistically random, but a significant fraction were spatially aggregated or segregated. Aggregated pairs dominated from the Carboniferous period (307 million years ago) to the early Holocene epoch (11,700 years before present), when there was a pronounced shift to more segregated pairs, a trend that continues in modern assemblages. The shift began during the Holocene and coincided with increasing human population size4,5 and the spread of agriculture in North America6,7. Before the shift, an average of 64{\%} of significant pairs were aggregated; after the shift, the average dropped to 37{\%}. The organization of modern and late Holocene plant and animal assemblages differs fundamentally from that of assemblages over the past 300 million years that predate the large-scale impacts of humans. Our results suggest that the rules governing the assembly of communities have recently been changed by human activity.},

abstract = {Aim: How do factors such as space, time, climate and other ecological drivers influ‐ ence food web structure and dynamics? Collections of well‐studied food webs and replicate food webs from the same system that span biogeographical and ecological gradients now enable detailed, quantitative investigation of such questions and help integrate food web ecology and macroecology. Here, we integrate macroecology and food web ecology by focusing on how ecogeographical rules [the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Rapoport's rule] are associated with the architecture of food webs. Location: Global. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: All taxa. Methods: We discuss the implications of each ecogeographical rule for food webs, present predictions for how food web structure will vary with each rule, assess empirical support where available, and discuss how food webs may influence ecogeo‐ graphical rules. Finally, we recommend systems and approaches for further advancing this research agenda. Results: We derived testable predictions for some ecogeographical rules (e.g. LDG, Rapoport's rule), while for others (e.g., Bergmann's and island rules) it is less clear how we would expect food webs to change over macroecological scales. Based on the LDG, we found weak support for both positive and negative relationships between food chain length and latitude and for increased generality and linkage density at higher latitudes. Based on Rapoport's rule, we found support for the prediction that species turnover in food webs is inversely related to latitude. Main conclusions: The macroecology of food webs goes beyond traditional ap‐ proaches to biodiversity at macroecological scales by focusing on trophic interactions among species. The collection of food web data for different types of ecosystems across biogeographical gradients is key to advance this research agenda. Further, considering food web interactions as a selection pressure that drives or disrupts eco‐ geographical rules has the potential to address both mechanisms of and deviations from these macroecological relationships. For these reasons, further integration of macroecology and food webs will help ecologists better understand the assembly, maintenance and change of ecosystems across space and time.},

This paper compares biotic interactions to co-occurrences and reveals that co-occurrences generally cannot be expected to reliably predict the presence of biotic interactions. The paper uses a well-studied and intensively sampled rocky intertidal zone as its model habitat. They also show that there is a difference in the detection rate of different interaction types, positive non-trophic interactions such as commensalism and facilitation being the most easily detected by co-occurrence. 

This information reinforces my statement in my ch1 that co-occurrences cannot be treated like interactions. However, it also reinforces the results of the Blois analysis in Chapter 2, which has a small proportion of biotic interactions which are all positive (and based on past experience, non-trophic).},

abstract = {Invasive and over-abundant predators pose a major threat to biodiversity and often benefit from human activities. Effective management requires understanding predator use of human-modified habitats (including resource subsidies and disturbed environments), and individual variation within populations. We investigated selection for human-modified habitats by invasive red foxes, Vulpes vulpes, within two predominantly forested Australian landscapes. We predicted that foxes would select for human-modified habitats in their range locations and fine-scale movements, but that selection would vary between individuals. We GPS-tracked 19 foxes for 17-166 days; ranges covered 33 to {\textgreater}2500 ha. Approximately half the foxes selected for human-modified habitats at the range scale, with some 'commuting' more than five kilometres to farmland or townships at night. Two foxes used burnt forest intensively after a prescribed fire. In their fine-scale nocturnal movements, most foxes selected for human-modified habitats such as reservoirs, forest edges and roads, but there was considerable individual variation. Native fauna in fragmented and disturbed habitats are likely to be exposed to high rates of fox predation, and anthropogenic food resources may subsidise fox populations within the forest interior. Coordinating fox control across land-tenures, targeting specific landscape features, and limiting fox access to anthropogenic resources will be important for biodiversity conservation.},

abstract = {Numerous anthropological and ecological hypotheses have been proposed to explain the extinction of many large-bodied mammals at the terminal Pleistocene. We find that body size distributions of all mammals in North America, South America, Africa and Australia before and after the late Pleistocene show a similar large-size selectivity of extinctions across con-tinents, despite differences in timing. All extinctions coincide with the colonization of the continent by aboriginal man, but only two coincide with periods of climate change. Further, historical (within the last 300 years) extinctions in Australia demonstrate a higher susceptibility of small and medium-sized mammals. On all four continents, large-bodied Recent mammals are threatened by human hunting practices, whereas small-bodied species are not. We conclude that the late Pleistocene extinctions were caused primarily by anthropogenic factors such as human hunting, whereas historical extinctions were due mostly to habitat alteration and exotic species introductions.},

@article{Plummer2006,
abstract = {At first sight, Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) appears to be straightforward. The user defines a full probability model, perhaps using one of the programs discussed in this issue; an underlying sampling engine takes the model definition and returns a sequence of dependent samples from the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the supplied data. The user can derive any summary of the posterior distribution from this sample. For example, to calculate a 95{\%} credible interval for a parameter $\alpha$, it suffices to take 1000 MCMC iterations of $\alpha$ and sort them so that $\alpha$1{\textless}$\alpha$2{\textless}...{\textless}$\alpha$1000. The credible interval estimate is then ($\alpha$25, $\alpha$975). However, there is a price to be paid for this simplicity. Unlike most numerical methods used in statistical inference, MCMC does not give a clear indication of whether it has converged. The underlying Markov chain theory only guarantees that the distribution of the output will converge to the posterior in the limit as the number of iterations increases to infinity. The user is generally ignorant about how quickly convergence occurs, and therefore has to fall back on post hoc testing of the sampled output. By convention, the sample is divided into two parts: a “burn in” period during which all samples are discarded, and the remainder of the run in which the chain is considered to have converged sufficiently close to the limiting distribution to be used. Two questions then arise: 1. How long should the burn in period be? 2. How many samples are required to accurately estimate posterior quantities of interest? The coda package for R contains a set of functions designed to help the user answer these questions. Some of these convergence diagnostics are simple graphical ways of summarizing the data. Others are formal statistical tests.},

abstract = {We reviewed recent literature to evaluate interactions between landscape structure (i.e., composition and configuration of landscapes) and overabundant and/or invasive species or “undesirable” species. Undesirable species are strongly associated with fragmented landscapes, especially those with linearly arranged elements to facilitate dispersal, and with land uses that serve as population sources. In some cases, structural legacies, such as land use histories, were as important as current landscape patterns. Many undesirable species also influenced landscape structure by altering disturbance regimes via a wide range of abiotic and biotic mechanisms, including by affecting abundance of keystone, foundation or engineering species at landscape scales, and by changing species interactions in ways that prompted community-level changes. In some instances, the effects of species on landscapes facilitated invasion and/or population growth to establish positive feedback cycles. Understanding the reciprocal effects of landscape pattern on invasive and overabundant species can help guide effective management strategies by increasing the cost-efficiency of conservation investments and prioritizing conservation actions.},

@article{Sepkoski1984,
abstract = {A three-phase kinetic model with time-specific perturbations is used to describe large-scale patterns in the diversification of Phanerozoic marine families. The basic model assumes that the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modem evolutionary faunas each diversified logistically as a consequence of early exponential growth and of later slowing of growth as the ecosystems became filled; it also assumes interaction among the evolutionary faunas such that expansion of the combined diversities of all three faunas above any single fauna's equilibrium caused that fauna's diversity to begin to decline. This basic model adequately describes the diversification of the evolutionary faunas through the Paleozoic Era as well as the asymmetrical rise and fall of background extinction rates through the entire Phanerozoic. Declines in diversity and changes in faunal dominance associated with mass extinctions can be accommodated in the model with short-term accelerations in extinction rates or declines in equilibria. Such accelerations, or perturbations, cause diversity to decline exponentially and then to rebound sigmoidally following release. The amount of decline is dependent on the magnitude and duration of the perturbation, the timing of the perturbation with respect to the diversification of the system, and the system's initial per-taxon rates of diversification and turnover. When applied to the three-phase model, such perturbations describe the changes in diversity and faunal dominance during and after major mass extinctions, the long-term rise in total diversity following the Late Permian and Norian mass extinctions, and the peculiar diversification and then decline of the remnants of the Paleozoic fauna during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras. The good fit of this model to data on Phanerozoic familial diversity suggests that many of the large-scale patterns of diversification seen in the marine fossil record of animal families are simple consequences of nonlinear interrelationships among a small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the evolutionary faunas and are largely (but not completely) invariant through time. {\textcopyright} 1984, Paleontological Society.

@article{Araujo2007,
abstract = {Aim: There is a debate as to whether biotic interactions exert a dominant role in governing species distributions at macroecological scales. The prevailing idea is that climate is the key limiting factor; thus models that use present-day climate–species range relationships are expected to provide reasonable means to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions. However, there is little empirical evidence that biotic interactions would not constrain species distributions at macroecological scales. We examine this idea, for the first time, and provide tests for two null hypotheses: ( H 0 1) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in explaining current distributions of a particular species of butterfly (clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne ) in Europe; and ( H 0 2) – biotic interactions do not exert a significant role in predictions of altered species' ranges under climate change. Location: Europe. Methods: Generalized additive modelling (GAM) was used to investigate relationships between species and climate; species and host plants; and species and climate + host plants. Because models are sensitive to the variable selection strategies utilised, four alternative approaches were used: AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), BRUTO (Adaptive Backfitting), and CROSS (Cross Selection). Results: In spite of the variation in the variables selected with different methods, both hypotheses ( H 0 1 and H 0 2) were falsified, providing support for the proposition that biotic interactions significantly affect both the explanatory and predictive power of bioclimatic envelope models at macro scales. Main conclusions: Our results contradict the widely held view that the effects of biotic interactions on individual species distributions are not discernible at macroecological scales. Results are contingent on the species, type of interaction and methods considered, but they call for more stringent evidence in support of the idea that purely climate-based modelling would be sufficient to quantify the impacts of climate change on species distributions.},

abstract = {Species roles in ecological networks combine to generate their architecture, which contributes to their stability. Species trait diversity also affects ecosystem functioning and resilience, yet it remains unknown whether species' contributions to functional diversity relate to their network roles. Here, we use 21 empirical pollen transport networks to characterise this relationship. We found that, apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners. Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially because key aspects of their flowering traits are conserved at a family level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight into mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {The extent of spatial partitioning in insectivorous bats, whose prey is patchily distributed and transient in nature, remains a contentious issue. The recent separation of a common Palaearctic bat, the pipistrelle, into Pipis-trellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, which are morphologically similar and sympatric, provides an opportunity to examine this question. The present study used radio telemetry to address the spatial distribution and foraging characteristics of P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus in northeast Scotland, to test the hypothesis that coexistence between these species is facilitated through spatial segregation. We reveal large and significant differences in the spatial distribution and foraging characteristics of these two cryptic species. Individual P. pipistrellus home ranges were on average three times as large as that of P. pygmaeus, and they foraged for approximately an hour longer each night. Inter-specific spatial overlap was minimal ({\textless}5{\%}) and core foraging areas of either species were essentially mutually exclusive despite the proximity of the two roosts. Inter-specific differences in range size were associated with the spatial dispersion of productive foraging sites within individual foraging ranges. P. pipistrellus foraging sites were highly dispersed, necessitating larger ranges. It is predicted that the spatial segregation revealed by the present study is a result of selection favouring the avoidance of competition in these species through differential habitat use.},

abstract = {Modern coexistence theory is increasingly used to explain how differences between competing species lead to coexistence versus competitive exclusion. Although research testing this theory has focused on deterministic cases of competitive exclusion, in which the same species always wins, mounting evidence suggests that competitive exclusion is often historically contingent, such that whichever species happens to arrive first excludes the other. Coexistence theory predicts that historically contingent exclusion, known as priority effects, will occur when large destabilizing differences (positive frequency-dependent growth rates of competitors), combined with small fitness differences (differences in competitors' intrinsic growth rates and sensitivity to competition), create conditions under which neither species can invade an established population of its competitor. Here we extend the empirical application of modern coexistence theory to determine the conditions that promote priority effects. We conducted pairwise invasion tests with four strains of nectar-colonizing yeasts to determine how the destabilizing and fitness differences that drive priority effects are altered by two abiotic factors characterizing the nectar environment: Sugar concentration and pH. We found that higher sugar concentrations increased the likelihood of priority effects by reducing fitness differences between competing species. In contrast, higher pH did not change the likelihood of priority effects, but instead made competition more neutral by bringing both fitness differences and destabilizing differences closer to zero. This study demonstrates how the empirical partitioning of priority effects into fitness and destabilizing components can elucidate the pathways through which environmental conditions shape competitive interactions.},

abstract = {Observational and experimental studies have shown that an interaction class between two species (be it mutualistic, competitive, antagonistic, or neutral) may switch to a different class, depending on the biotic and abiotic factors within which species are observed. This complexity arising from the evidence of context-dependencies has underscored a difficulty in establishing a systematic analysis about the extent to which species interactions are expected to switch in nature and experiments. Here, we propose an overarching theoretical framework, by integrating probabilistic and structural approaches, to establish null expectations about switches of interaction classes across environmental contexts. This integration provides a systematic platform upon which it is possible to establish new hypotheses, clear predictions, and quantifiable expectations about the context-dependency of species interactions.},

P. auritus emerged from the roost before dusk, foraged singly in woodland areas with slow, hovering flight and fed on insects commonly found flying in woodland, on insects and spiders gleaned from foliage and on insects caught inside the roost. M. daubentoni emerged from the roost after dusk, flew fast and low over water and around riparian vegetation and foraged on long, straight beats.

abstract = {Recent studies connecting the decline of large predators and consumers with the disintegration of ecosystems often over- look that this natural experiment already occurred. As recently as 14 ka, tens of millions of large-bodied mammals were widespread across the American continents. Within 1000 yr of the arrival of humans, ∼ 80{\%} were extinct including all ? 600 kg. While the cause of the late Pleistocene (LP) extinction remains contentious, largely overlooked are the eco- logical consequences of the loss of millions of large-bodied animals. Here, we examine the influence of the LP extinction on a local mammal community. Our study site is Hall's Cave in the Great Plains of Texas, which has unparalleled fine-grained temporal resolution over the past 20 ka, allowing characterization of the community before and after the extinction. In step with continental patterns, this community lost 80{\%} of large-bodied herbivores and 20{\%} of apex predators at the LP extinction. Using tightly constrained temporal windows spanning full glacial to modern time periods and comprehensive faunal lists, we reconstruct mammal associations and body size distributions over time. We find changes in alpha and beta diversity, and in the statistical moments associated with periods of climate change as well as with the LP extinction event. Additionally, there is a fundamental change in the composition of herbivores, with grazers being replaced by frugivores/ granivores starting about 15 ka; the only large-bodied grazer remaining today is the bison Bison bison. Moreover, the null model program PAIRS reveals interesting temporal patterns in the disassociation or co-occurrence of species through the terminal Pleistocene and Holocene. Extinct species formed more significant associations than modern ones, and formed more aggregated pairs than do modern species. Further, negative species associations were about three times stronger than positive ones, suggesting that competitive interactions or environmental filtering are a strong force in community structure.},

abstract = {Standard Bayesian inference is known to be sensitive to model misspecification, leading to unreliable uncertainty quantification and poor predictive performance. However, finding generally applicable and computationally feasible methods for robust Bayesian inference under misspecification has proven to be a difficult challenge. An intriguing, easy-to-use, and widely applicable approach is to use bagging on the Bayesian posterior ("BayesBag"); that is, to use the average of posterior distributions conditioned on bootstrapped datasets. In this paper, we develop the asymptotic theory of BayesBag, propose a model-data mismatch index for model criticism using BayesBag, and empirically validate our theory and methodology on synthetic and real-world data in linear regression, sparse logistic regression, and a hierarchical mixed effects model. We find that in the presence of significant misspecification, BayesBag yields more reproducible inferences and has better predictive accuracy than the standard Bayesian posterior; on the other hand, when the model is correctly specified, BayesBag produces superior or equally good results. Overall, our results demonstrate that BayesBag combines the attractive modeling features of standard Bayesian inference with the distributional robustness properties of frequentist methods, providing benefits over both Bayes alone and the bootstrap alone.},

We predicted that abundant livestock could reduce starvation and foraging effort, allowing for greater investments in immunity.

Here, we show that persistent anthropogenic landscapes for the past 4,500 years have had an enduring legacy on the hyperdominance of edible plants in modern forests in the eastern Amazon. We found an abrupt enrichment of edible plant species in fossil lake and terrestrial records associated with pre-Columbian occupation. Our results demonstrate that, through closed-canopy forest enrichment, limited clearing for crop cultivation and low-severity fire management, long-term food security was attained despite climate and social changes. Our results suggest that, in the eastern Amazon, the subsistence basis for the development of complex societies began {\~{}}4,500 years ago with the adoption of polyculture agroforestry, combining the cultivation of multiple annual crops with the progressive enrichment of edible forest species and the exploitation of aquatic resources. This subsistence strategy intensified with the later development of Amazonian dark earths, enabling the expansion of maize cultivation to the Belterra Plateau, providing a food production system that sustained growing human populations in the eastern Amazon. Furthermore, these millennial-scale polyculture agroforestry systems have an enduring legacy on the hyperdominance of edible plants in modern forests in the eastern Amazon. Together, our data provide a long-term example of past anthropogenic land use that can inform management and conservation efforts in modern Amazonian ecosystems.},

By evaluating the phylogenetic pattern of assemblages, we gain insight into the relative contribution of these mechanisms to generating observed assemblages. We address some limitations in the field of community phylogenetics by using simulations, biologically relevant null models, and cost distance analysis to evaluate simultaneous mechanisms leading to observed patterns of co-occurrence. Building from past studies of phylogenetic community structure, we applied our approach to hummingbird assemblages in the Northern Andes. We compared the relationship between relatedness and co-occurrence among predicted assemblages, based on estimates of suitable habitat and dispersal limitation, and observed assemblages. Hummingbird co-occurrence peaked at intermediate relatedness and decreased when a closely-related species was present. This result was most similar to simulations that included simultaneous effects of phylogenetic conservatism and repulsion. In addition, we found older sister taxa were only weakly more separated by geographic barriers, suggesting that time since dispersal is unlikely to be the sole factor influencing co-occurrence of closely related species. Our analysis highlights the role of multiple mechanisms acting simultaneously, and provides a hypothesis for the potential importance of competition at regional scales.},

abstract = {The nested subset hypothesis states that the species comprising a depauperate insular biota are a proper subset of those in richer biotas, and that an archipelago of such biotas, ranked by species richness, presents a nested series. The pattern characterizes the distributions of mammals in three different archipel- agos, and it appears more strongly developed among faunas in the process of relaxation (landbridge is- lands) than in those derived by overwater coloniza- tion (oceanic islands). The generality of the nested subset pattern and factors that may produce it are evaluated using distributions of land birds in the New Zealand region. Monte Carlo simulations show that species composition of these insular avifaunas is highly nonrandom, exhibiting significantly nested structure. However, avifaunas on nine oceanic islands lack the structure typical of all islands together or of the 22 landbridge islands. Thus, distinctive patterns of species composition, as well as species number, may distin- guish landbridge and oceanic islands. Because they are isolated fragments of once- continuous distributions, landbridge islands and their biotas have important implications for long-term bi- ological conservation in preserves. Real or virtual is- lands that have undergone faunal relaxation support only a fraction of the species expected in equivalent mainland areas. Furthermore, the species inhabiting fragments are not a random collection of those in the source pool, but are rather nested subsets of the species in richer, more intact biotas. The species preserved in such fragments tend to be the most abundant, generalist species that are least in need of special protection.},

abstract = {There appears to be no single axis of causality between life and its landscape, but rather, each exerts a simultane- ous infl uence on the other over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. These infl uences occur through feedbacks of differing strength and importance with co-evolution representing the tightest coupling between biological and geomorphological systems. The ongoing failure to incorporate these dynamic bio-physical interactions with human activity in landscape studies limits our ability to predict the response of landscapes to human disturbance and climate change. This limitation is a direct result of the poor communication between the ecological and geomorphological communities and consequent paucity of interdisciplinary research. Recognition of this failure led to the organization of the Meeting of Young Researchers in Earth Science (MYRES) III, titled ‘Dynamic Interactions of Life and its Landscape'. This paper synthesizes and expands upon key issues and findings from that meeting, to help chart a course for future collaboration among Earth surface scientists and ecologists: it represents the con- sensus view of a competitively selected group of 77 early-career researchers. Two broad themes that serve to focus and motivate future research are identifi ed: (1) co-evolution of landforms and biological communities; and (2) humans as modifi ers of the landscape (through direct and indirect actions). Also outlined are the state of the art in analytical, experimental and modelling techniques in ecological and geomorphological research, and novel new research avenues that combine these techniques are suggested. It is hoped that this paper will serve as an interdisciplinary reference for geomorphologists and ecologists looking to learn more about the other fi eld.

abstract = {Ecologists widely accept that the distribution of abundances inmost communities is fairly flat but heavily dominated by a few species. The reason for this is that species abundances are thought to follow certain theoretical distribu- tions that predict such a pattern.However, previous studies have focusedon either a fewtheoretical distributions or a few empirical distributions. I illustrate abundance patterns in 1055 samples of trees, bats, small terrestrial mam- mals, birds, lizards, frogs, ants, dung beetles, butterflies, and odonates. Five existing theoretical distributions make inaccurate predictions about the frequencies of the most common species and of the average species, andmost of them fit the overall patterns poorly, according to the maximum likelihood–related Kullback-Leibler divergence statistic. Instead, the data support a low-dominance distribution here called the “double geometric.” Depending on the value of its two governing parameters, itmay resemble either the geometric series distribution or the lognormal series distribution. However, unlike any othermodel, it assumes both that richness is finite and that species compete unequally for resources in a two-dimensional niche landscape,which implies that niche breadths are variable and that trait distributions are neither arrayed along a single dimension nor randomly associated. The hypothesis that niche space ismultidimensional helps to explain how numerous species can coexist despite interacting strongly. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {A central tenet of ecology and biogeography is that the broad outlines of species ranges are determined by climate, whereas the effects of biotic interactions are manifested at local scales. While the first proposition is supported by ample evidence, the second is still a matter of controversy. To address this question, we develop a mathematical model that predicts the spatial overlap, i.e. co-occurrence, between pairs of species subject to all possible types of interactions. We then identify the scale of resolution in which predicted range overlaps are lost. We found that co-occurrence arising from positive interactions, such as mutualism (+/+) and commensalism (+/0), are manifested across scales. Negative interactions, such as competition (-/-) and amensalism (-/0), generate checkerboard patterns of co-occurrence that are discernible at finer resolutions but that are lost and increasing scales of resolution. Scale dependence in consumer-resource interactions (+/-) depends on the strength of positive dependencies between species. If the net positive effect is greater than the net negative effect, then interactions scale up similarly to positive interactions. Our results challenge the widely held view that climate alone is sufficient to characterize species distributions at broad scales, but also demonstrate that the spatial signature of competition is unlikely to be discernible beyond local and regional scales.},

abstract = {The potential for large-scale biodiversity losses as a result of climate change and human impact presents major challenges for ecology and conservation science. Governments around the world have established national parks and wildlife reserves to help protect biodiversity, but there are few studies on the long-term consequences of this strategy. We use Kenya as a case study to investigate species richness and other attributes of mammal communities in 6 protected areas over the past century. Museum records from African expeditions that comprehensively sampled mammals from these same areas in the early 1900's provide a baseline for evaluating changes in species richness and community structure over time. We compare species lists assembled from archived specimens (1896–1950) to those of corresponding modern protected areas (1950– 2013). Species richness in Kenya was stable or increased at 5 out of 6 sites from historical to modern times. Beta-diversity, in contrast, decreased across all sites. Potential biases such as variable historical vs. modern collection effort and detection of small-bodied, rare, and low-visibility species do not account for the observed results. We attribute the pattern of decreased beta diversity primarily to increased site occupancy by common species across all body size classes. Despite a decrease in land area available to wildlife, our data do not show the extinctions predicted by species-area relationships. Moreover, the results indicate that species-area curves based solely on protected areas could underestimate diversity because they do not account for mammal species whose ranges extend beyond protected area boundaries. We conclude that the 6 protected areas have been effective in preserving species richness in spite of continuing conversion of wild grasslands to cropland, but the overall decrease in beta diversity indicates a decline in the uniqueness of mammal communities that historically characterized Kenya's varied landscape.},

abstract = {Viable populations of species occur in a given place if three conditions are met: the environment at the place is suitable; the species is able to colonize it; co-occurrence is possible despite or because of interactions with other species. Studies investigating the effects of climate change on species have mainly focused on measuring changes in climate suitability. Complex interactions among species have rarely been explored in such studies. We extend network theory to the analysis of complex patterns of co-occurrence among species. The framework is used to explore the robustness of networks under climate change. With our data, we show that networks describing the geographic pattern of co-occurrence among species display properties shared by other complex networks, namely that most species are poorly connected to other species in the network and only a few are highly connected. In our example, species more exposed to climate change tended to be poorly connected to other species within the network, while species more connected tended to be less exposed. Such high connectance would make the co-occurrence networks more robust to climate change. The proposed framework illustrates how network analysis could be used, together with co-occurrence data, to help addressing the potential consequences of species interactions in studies of climate change and biodiversity. However, more research is needed to test for links between co-occurrence and network interactions.},
annote = {Method for valuing co-occurrences: use a distance metric and then weed out species with expected overlap. The expected overlap is based on the expected frequency of finding both species ({\#}Sites * Pa * Pb) and its variance. The weeding method seems to work quite well in general, but if you look at the numbers it ends up excluding pairs at different alpha levels depending on the situation. For example, if the probability distribution has a low variance (peaked), this method might include a pair whose observed overlap probability is 15{\%}, but in other situations exclude a pair whose observed overlap probability is less than 5{\%}.},

He presented his model as a new procedure, a ‘pairwise approach', different from analyses of whole presence–absence matrices to examine patterns of co-occurrence. Here I show that: (1) Veech's method is identical to Fisher's exact test, a standard procedure for measuring the statistical association between two discrete variables; (2) in a broad sense, the pairwise approach is very similar to early analyses of spatial association, such as the one advanced by Forbes in 1907; (3) implicit in Veech's formula is a sampling scheme that is indistinguishable from well-known matrix-level null models that randomize the distribution of species among equiprobable sites; (4) pairwise co-occurrence patterns can be analysed using any matrix-level null model, so pairwise comparisons are not limited to using Veech's formula. The methodological distinction that Veech proposed between pairwise and matrix-level approaches does not in fact exist, although the conceptual distinction between the two approaches is still a debated topic.},

The argument about Fisher's hypergeometric test seems pretty solid, though I'm unconvinced that the emphasis on the F-E SIM2 algorithm was warranted. Veech recognized the conceptual connection between his algorithm and SIM2, but asserted that his algorithm sidesteps the error problems with randomizations. This paper did not mention errors.

To understand the consequences of their demise for community assembly, we tracked community structure through the end-Pleistocene megafaunal extinction in North America. We decomposed the effects of biotic and abiotic factors by analyzing co-occurrence within the mutual ranges of species pairs. Although shifting climate drove an increase in niche overlap, co-occurrence decreased, signaling shifts in biotic interactions. Furthermore, the effect of abiotic factors on co-occurrence remained constant over time while the effect of biotic factors decreased. Biotic factors apparently played a key role in continental-scale community assembly before the extinctions.

One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that outcompetes both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known interactions, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. Markov networks consistently outperformed the other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, which controlled for indirect effects with partial correlations or generalized linear models, also performed well. Null models showed no evidence of being able to control for indirect effects, and reliably yielded incorrect inferences when such effects were present.},

abstract = {The discipline-wide effort to database the fossil record at the occurrence level has made it possible to estimate marine invertebrate extinction and origination rates with much greater accuracy. The new data show that two biotic mechanisms have hastened recoveries from mass extinctions and confined diversity to a relatively narrow range over the past 500 million years (Myr). First, a drop in diversity of any size correlates with low extinction rates immediately afterward, so much so that extinction would almost come to a halt if diversity dropped by 90{\%}. Second, very high extinction rates are followed by equally high origination rates. The two relationships predict that the rebound from the current mass extinction will take at least 10 Myr, and perhaps 40 Myr if it rivals the Permo-Triassic catastrophe. Regardless, any large event will result in a dramatic ecological and taxonomic restructuring of the biosphere. The data also confirm that extinction and origination rates both declined through the Phanerozoic and that several extinctions in addition to the Permo-Triassic event were particularly severe. However, the trend may be driven by taxonomic biases and the rates vary in accord with a simple log normal distribution, so there is no sharp distinction between background and mass extinctions. Furthermore, the lack of any significant autocorrelation in the data is inconsistent with macroevolutionary theories of periodicity or self-organized criticality. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Aim To develop a new probabilistic model that can be used to test for statistically significant pair-wise patterns of species co-occurrence. The model gives the prob- ability that two specieswould co-occur at a frequency less than (or greater than) the observed frequency if the two species were distributed independently of one another among a set of sites. Themodel can be used to classify species associations as negative, positive or random. Innovation Historically, the analysis of species co-occurrence has involved the use of data randomization. An observed species presence–absence matrix is compared with randomized matrices to determine if the observed matrix has structure, either an excess or deficit of species positively or negatively associated with each other. The computer algorithms used to randomize matrices can sometimes produce Type I and Type II errors (when the randomization algorithm produces a biased set of all possible matrices) due to the randomization process itself. The probabilistic model does not rely on any data randomization, hence it has a very lowType I error rate and is powerful having a low Type II error rate. Main conclusionsWhen applied to 10 different data sets the probabilistic model revealed significant positive and negative species associations in most of the data sets. Compared with previous analyses the model tended to find fewer significant associations; this may indicate a generally lowrate of Type I error in the model. The model is easy to implement and requires no special software. The model could potentially transform the way that ecologists test for species co-occurrence in a wide range of ecological studies.

Amazonia was a major centre of crop domestication, with at least 83 native species containing populations domesticated to some degree. Plant domestication occurs in domesticated landscapes, including highly modified Amazonian dark earths (ADEs) associated with large settled populations and that may cover greater than 0.1{\%} of the region. Populations and food production expanded rapidly within land management systems in the mid-Holocene, and complex societies expanded in resource-rich areas creating domesticated landscapes with profound impacts on local and regional ecology. ADE food production projections support estimates of at least eight million people in 1492. By this time, highly diverse regional systems had developed across Amazonia where subsistence resources were created with plant and landscape domestication, including earthworks. This review argues that the Amazonian anthrome was no less socio-culturally diverse or populous than other tropical forested areas of the world prior to European conquest.},

This paper evaluates four methods called shareholder quorum subsampling, true richness estimated using a Poisson sampling model (TRiPS), squares, and the corrected first-order jackknife (cJ1). Quorum subsampling interpolates to produce a relative richness estimate, while the other three extrapolate to the size of the overall species pool. Here I use routine ecological data to show that squares and cJ1 pass several basic validation tests, but TRiPS does not. First, TRiPS estimates are insensitive to the shape of abundance distributions, being entirely predicted by total counts of species and of individuals regardless of the details. Furthermore, TRiPS tends not to extrapolate at all when sampling is moderate or intense. Second, all three extrapolators yield lower values when they work with small uniform subsamples of large raw inventories. The third test is a split-analyze-and-sum analysis: each inventory is divided between the most common and least common halves of the abundance distribution, the methods are applied to the half-inventories, and the estimates are summed. Squares and cJ1 perform well here, but TRiPS does not extrapolate as long as the full inventories are reasonably well-sampled. It is otherwise not particularly accurate. The extrapolators are largely insensitive to the influence of abundance distribution evenness, as quantified using Pielou's J and a new index called the ratio of means. Quorum subsampling generally performs well, but it stumbles on the split-analyze-and-sum test and is confounded somewhat by evenness. },

abstract = {When measured by extent and intensity, urbanization is one of the most homogenizing of all major human activities. Cities homogenize the physical environment because they are built to meet the relatively narrow needs of just one species, our own. Also, cities are maintained for centuries in a disequilibrium state from the local natural environment by the importation of vast resources of energy and materials. Consequently, as cities expand across the planet, biological homogenization increases because the same "urban-adaptable" species become increasingly widespread and locally abundant in cities across the planet. As urbanization often produces a local gradient of disturbance, one can also observe a gradient of homogenization. Synanthropic species adapted to intensely modified built habitats at the urban core are "global homogenizers", found in cities worldwide. However, many suburban and urban fringe habitats are occupied by native species that become regionally widespread. These suburban adapters typically consist of early successional plants and "edge" animal species such as mesopredator mammals, and ground-foraging, omnivorous and frugivorous birds that can utilize gardens, forest fragments and many other habitats available in the suburbs. A basic conservation challenge is that urban biota is often quite diverse and very abundant. The intentional and unintentional importation of species adapted to urban habitats, combined with many food resources imported for human use, often produces local species diversity and abundance that is often equal to or greater than the surrounding landscape. With the important exception of low-income areas, urban human populations often inhabit richly cultivated suburban habitats with a relatively high local floral and faunal diversity and/or abundance without awareness of the global impoverishment caused by urbanization. Equally challenging is that, because so many urban species are immigrants adapting to city habitats, urbanites of all income levels become increasingly disconnected from local indigenous species and their natural ecosystems. Urban conservation should therefore focus on promoting preservation and restoration of local indigenous species.},

abstract = {The object of our study was to compare the distributions of bird species common to two Andean localities in order to improve our understanding of the factors involved as primary causes in imposing distributional limits. A previous paper (Terborgh 1971) had evaluated the importance of three mechanisms in the avifauna of a control locality: (1) factors that vary continuously and in parallel with the elevational gradient, (2) competitive exclusion, and (3) ecotones. As was discussed in that paper, the method, when applied to a single tran- sect, leads to a systematic underestimation of the incidence of competition-mediated limits and to an overestimation of ecotone effects. By studying appropriately selected test localities, we could overcome many of these deficiencies and obtain results that are several steps closer to expressing reality. The control locality, the Cordillera Vilcabamba, is a sector of the Cordillera Oriental, or eastern chain of the main body of the Peruvian Andes. It carries what may be regarded as a complete avifauna, as the transect sliced through a continuous belt of forested terrain which, at any elevation, is exposed to invasion by appropriately adapted species from above and below as well as laterally. It differs in this respect from the test locality (Cerros del Sira), which is an isolated massif that rises out of the Amazonian plain some 100 km east of the main Andes. Because of this isolation, the upper portions of the Sira are exposed to invasion principally from below. An estimated 80{\%}-82{\%} of the species that would have occupied the summit zone of the Sira, had it been a portion of the main body of the Andes, were missing. Such a species deficit provides an ideal test of the efficacy of competition in limiting distributions, because it invites whatever species are available as colonists (in this case, those lower on the mountain) to invade until the community is effectively filled. Of the species that had the opportunity to expand their elevational ranges in the absence of high-elevation congeners that apparently excluded them on the control transect, a minimum of 71{\%} did so, confirming the original assignments of these as competition-limited species in the control locality. In addition, a majority (58{\%}) of the species that had no high-elevation congener on the control transect (assigned to the gradient mechanism), and that had the opportunity to expand into the species- deficit zone of the Sira, were found to do so. This reveals that diffuse competition (as dis- tinguished from the directly observable exclusion of congeners) was really the primary limiting mechanism for most of the species that had been assigned to the gradient mechanism in the control study. Instead of accounting for approximately a third of all distributional limits, as was concluded in the earlier report, it now appears that competition, both direct and diffuse, accounts for something more than two-thirds of the distributional limits of Andean birds whose ranges end somewhere between the lowland plain and tree line.

abstract = {Because common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., henceforth Ambrosia) has negative effects on human health, it is a common focus for management, which would benefit from a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which the species spreads. Road systems are known to be invasion corridors, but the conduit function of vehicles for the rapid spread of Ambrosia along roads and for population extension along roadside verges has not yet been demonstrated convincingly. To quantify the effect of different traffic volumes on the dispersal and population extension of Ambrosia, we used two approaches: First, by combining field experiments along roads with records of the seed rain around single plants, we simulated a combined dispersal kernel that revealed the interactions between primary dispersal and traffic-mediated secondary dispersal. Second, we recorded the seedling recruitment around isolated roadside populations over 2 years to determine how traffic-related parameters affect population extension. The longest traffic-mediated dispersal distances exceeded those of primary dispersal by about one order of magnitude. Traffic volume had a significant positive effect on dispersal distances and on the lateral deposition of seeds on the road verge. Seedling recruitment around isolated roadside populations was significantly higher in the driving direction than against, but only at the distance where the major seed rain of traffic-mediated dispersal is to be expected according to the combined dispersal kernel (3–15 m). Synthesis and applications. This study isolates the effects of road traffic from confounding mechanisms (e.g. mowing machinery, propagule pressure from infested fields) on common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) invasions. Results demonstrate the traffic-mediated dispersal in Ambrosia invasions as a routine and predictable process that facilitates population extension in the direction of traffic along roadsides, depending on traffic volume. This highlights the importance of prioritizing mowing along high use roads and mowing of isolated populations to prevent seed abscission and further spread of common ragweed.},

abstract = {Grazing by domestic livestock is sometimes promoted as a management tool to benefit biodiversity. In many situations, however, it can produce negative outcomes. Here, we examine the impacts of recent and historic livestock grazing on bird communities in the semi-arid woodlands in eastern Australia, testing the notion that grazing removes the suppressive effect of structurally complex vegetation on miners, thereby reducing the richness and abundance of small birds. We used time- and area-limited searches of 108 sites varying in livestock grazing history and intensity, to explore the direct and indirect effects of grazing, habitat complexity and the abundance of aggressive, large-bodied birds on smaller-bodied birds using two-way analysis of variance and structural equation modelling. Small birds were less abundant and had lower richness in the presence of miners. Our structural equation models indicated that recent grazing had direct suppressive effects on the abundance of miners, and both richness and abundance of all but the largest-bodied bird groups. However, higher levels of historic livestock grazing reinforced the competitive exclusion of the six small-bodied bird groups (insectivores, nectarivores, declining woodland birds, small ground-foraging birds, all small birds and all non-miners) by aggressive miners via reductions in habitat complexity. Moreover, the strength of any suppressive effects on small birds or positive effects on large birds by miners increased with increasing miner abundance. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of vegetation structural complexity, not only for providing habitat for woodland birds, but also as barriers to the invasion and competitive dominance of miners. Our findings suggest that management actions aimed at reducing tree and shrub density to promote open woodlands are likely to have significant negative consequences for the conservation of small woodland birds.},

abstract = {Recent renewed interest in using fossil data to understand how biotic interactions have shaped the evolution of life is challenging the widely held assumption that long-term climate changes are the primary drivers of biodiversity change. New approaches go beyond traditional richness and co-occurrence studies to explicitly model biotic interactions using data on fossil and modern biodiversity. Important developments in three primary areas of research include analysis of (i) macroevolutionary rates, (ii) the impacts of and recovery from extinction events, and (iii) how humans (Homo sapiens) affected interactions among non-human species. We present multiple lines of evidence for an important and measurable role of biotic interactions in shaping the evolution of communities and lineages on long timescales. Biotic Interactions in the Fossil Record Biotic interactions occur when organisms living in the same community directly or indirectly influence one another. Biotic interactions can occur within or among species, be positive or negative, and cover a wide range of interactions including predation, commensalism, mutualism, resource competition, and parasitism [1]. Biotic interactions play an important role in structuring modern communities (e.g., [2]). Understanding their importance in the past therefore has the potential to shed light on their role in shaping ancient and recent diversity patterns. Historically, however, the study of biotic interactions in the fossil record has largely focused on direct physical evidence of interactions such as bore holes in shells, plant damage by insects, patterns of bryozoan encrustation, rare occurrences of gut contents, and carnivore damage on bones (e.g., [3,4]). Analysis of unusually well-preserved fossil assemblages allows reconstruction of trophic relationships among diverse organisms (e.g., [5]) and earlier work documented long-term trends in ecospace (see Glossary) occupation [6]. However, temporally continuous evidence for biotic interactions (traditionally thought to structure biodiversity on only very limited spatiotemporal scales [7]) with appropriate temporal resolution (i.e., high-resolution stratigraphic sequences) is only rarely preserved. Consequently, paleontologists have focused primarily on the more accessible long-term trends in climate as important regulators of biodiversity and the differential success of species (e.g., [8]); only short-term ecological phenomena or long-term patterns that cannot be explained by climate have typically been attributed to the outcome of biotic interactions (e.g., [9], but see [6]). However, as the only source of sufficiently long-term data, and in light of several recent methodological advances, the fossil record is now uniquely positioned to answer many of the questions at the core of the evolutionary and ecological sciences. Herein, we address important recent advances in understanding the role of biotic interactions in shaping macroevolutionary and macroecological phenomena in the fossil record (Figure 1) and highlight areas of future research we believe will be illuminating. In this review, we exclude studies of physical evidence for interactions, except where they are used to contextualize large-scale biodiversity patterns. Highlights Challenging the widespread perspective that long-term diversity patterns are shaped primarily by climate is not possible without using fossil record data to understand the role of biotic interactions. Important recent development and application of models that utilize data of both living and extinct species have enabled analyses to move beyond simply excluding potential abiotic drivers to explicitly modeling biotic drivers for the first time. Analyses of paleontological data show that biotic interactions shape the temporal diversity trajectories and rates of origination and extinction for numerous taxa. Extinction of keystone species has disproportionate impacts on biotic interactions among surviving species. Recovery from extinction events can be sped up or slowed down by biotic interactions among surviving species. Historically, humans (Homo sapiens) have acted as large, generalist predators, disrupting interaction networks among non-human species.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic habitat alteration may affect the dispersal service provided by avian seed dispersers, ultimately causing regeneration collapse, through a decay in both the quantitative (seed removal) and qualitative (seed arrival to safe sites) components of seed dispersal effectiveness. However, despite its implications for management in real-world landscapes, few studies have investigated the shifts in components of seed dispersal effectiveness resulting from habitat alteration. We advocate the use of stage-specific transition probabilities, combined with data on seed shadows and bird abundance and mobility, for a mechanistic inference of the consequences for recruitment of the disruption of plant-frugivore mutualism in altered habitats. Such an approach allows the identification of regeneration bottlenecks, evaluates the differential contribution to recruitment of quantitative and qualitative components of seed dispersal, and provides the means to compare seed dispersal limitation. We exemplify our conceptual approach with studies of seed dispersal and recruitment in the wild olive tree in unaltered and severely altered adjacent sites. We show that simplification of the habitat substantially affected bird abundance, diversity and mobility, which caused a reduction in fruit removal and a concomitant simplification of the seed shadows compared to the unaltered site. Linked to these shifts, postdispersal seed survival and seedling emergence and survival were affected. The final outcome of habitat alteration was the collapse of the regeneration dynamics with very few seeds escaping the influence of maternal plants and reaching the safest sites for recruitment (dispersal limitation). As predicted, the collapse in the regeneration dynamics resulted from severe decays in the quantitative but especially in the qualitative components of seed dispersal effectiveness. Management of fleshy-fruited plant populations in altered habitats should thus pay attention to landscape elements that promote frugivore abundance, diversity and mobility and that alleviate the dispersal limitation.},

abstract = {Understanding heterogeneity in species richness between closely related clades is a key research question in ecology and evolutionary biology. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to interpret such diversity contrasts across the tree of life, with most studies focusing on speciation rates to explain clades' evolutionary radiations, while often neglecting extinction rates. Here we study a notorious biological model as exemplified by the sister relationships between mackerel sharks (Lamniformes, 15 extant species) and ground sharks (Carcharhiniformes, ∼290 extant species). Using a comprehensive fossil dataset, we found that the diversity dynamics of lamniforms waxed and waned following repeated cycles of radiation phases and declining phases. Radiation phases peaked up to 3 times the current diversity in the early Late Cretaceous. In the last 20 million years, the group declined to its present-day diversity. Along with a higher extinction risk for young species, we further show that this declining pattern is likely attributed to a combination of abiotic and biotic factors, with a cooling-driven extinction (negative correlation between temperature and extinction) and clade competition with some ground sharks. Competition from multiple clades successively drove the demise and replacement of mackerel sharks due to a failure to originate facing the rise of ground sharks, particularly since the Eocene. These effects came from ecologically similar carcharhiniform species inhibiting diversification of medium- and large-sized lamniforms. These results imply that the interplay between abiotic and biotic drivers had a substantial role in extinction and speciation, respectively, which determines the sequential rise and decline of marine apex predators.},

abstract = {Humans, unlike any other multicellular species in Earth's history, have emerged as a global force that is transforming the ecology of an entire planet. It is no longer possible to understand, predict, or successfully manage ecological pattern, process, or change without understanding why and how humans reshape these over the long term. Here, a general causal theory is presented to explain why human societies gained the capacity to globally alter the patterns, processes, and dynamics of ecology and how these anthropogenic alterations unfold over time and space as societies themselves change over human generational time. Building on existing theories of ecosystem engineering, niche construction, inclusive inheritance, cultural evolution, ultrasociality, and social change, this theory of anthroecological change holds that sociocultural evolution of subsistence regimes based on ecosystem engineering, social specialization, and non-kin exchange, or "sociocultural niche construction," is the main cause of both the long-term upscaling of human societies and their unprecedented transformation of the biosphere. Human sociocultural niche construction can explain, where classic ecological theory cannot, the sustained transformative effects of human societies on biogeography, ecological succession, ecosystem processes, and the ecological patterns and processes of landscapes, biomes, and the biosphere. Anthroecology theory generates empirically testable hypotheses on the forms and trajectories of long-term anthropogenic ecological change that have significant theoretical and practical implications across the subdisciplines of ecology and conservation. Though still at an early stage of development, anthroecology theory aligns with and integrates established theoretical frameworks including social-ecological systems, social metabolism, countryside biogeography, novel ecosystems, and anthromes. The "fluxes of nature" are fast becoming "cultures of nature." To investigate, understand, and address the ultimate causes of anthropogenic ecological change, not just the consequences, human sociocultural processes must become as much a part of ecological theory and practice as biological and geophysical processes are now. Strategies for achieving this goal and for advancing ecological science and conservation in an increasingly anthropogenic biosphere are presented.},

abstract = {A central problem in ecology is to understand how human impacts affect plant–animal interactions that lead to effective seed dispersal services for plant communities. Seed dispersal services are the outcome of plant–frugivore interactions that often form local networks of interacting species. Recent work has shown that some frugivorous bird species are more critical to network organization than others. Here, we explore how patch size and the potential local extinctions of obligate frugivorous birds affect the reorganization of seed dispersal networks. We examined the structure of 20 empirical seed dispersal networks documented across tropical avian assemblages occupying widely variable habitat patch sizes, a surrogate of the amount of remaining habitat. Networks within small forest patches consistently supported both lower plant and bird species richness. Forest patch size was positively associated with nestedness, indicating that reductions in patch size disrupted the nested organization of seed dispersal networks. Obligate frugivores, especially large-bodied species, were almost entirely absent from small forest patches. Analysis at the species level showed that obligate frugivores formed the core of interacting species, connecting species within a given seed dispersal network. Our combined results revealed that patch size reduction erodes frugivorous bird diversity, thereby affecting the integrity of seed dispersal networks. We highlight the importance of conserving large forest patches to maintain tropical forest functionality.},

abstract = {Aim  To test for non-random co-occurrence in 36 species of grassland birds using a new metric and the C-score. The analysis used presence–absence data of birds distributed among 305 sites (or landscapes) over a period of 35 years. This analysis departs from traditional analyses of species co-occurrence in its use of temporal data and of individual species' probabilities of occurrence to derive analytically the expected co-occurrence between paired species. Location  Great Plains region, USA. Methods  Presence–absence data for the bird species were obtained from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The analysis was restricted to species pairs whose geographic ranges overlapped. Each of 541 species pairs was classified as a positive, negative, or non-significant association depending on the mean difference between the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence over the 35-year time-span. Results  Of the 541 species pairs that were examined, 202 to 293 (37–54{\%}) were positively associated, depending on which of two null models was used. However, only a few species pairs ({\textless}5{\%}) were negatively associated. An additional 89 species pairs did not have overlapping ranges and hence represented de facto negative associations. The results from analyses based on C-scores generally agreed with the analyses based on the difference between observed and expected co-occurrence, although the latter analyses were slightly more powerful. Main conclusions  Grassland birds within the Great Plains region are primarily distributed among landscapes either independently or in conjunction with one another. Only a few species pairs exhibited repulsed or segregated distributions. This indicates that the shared preference for grassland habitat may be more important in producing coexistence than are negative species interactions in preventing it. The large number of non-significant associations may represent random associations and thereby indicate that the presence/absence of other grassland bird species may have little effect on whether a given focal species is also found within the landscape. In a broader context, the probability-based approach used in this study may be useful in future studies of species co-occurrence.},
annote = {Veech employs his probabilistic approach for the first time using BBS data in the great plains. He deliberately removes species pairs that do not overlap geographically, effectively removing on biogeographic segregations. His results reflect many more significant aggregations than segregations. However, a smaller analysis with theoretically competing sparrow species also turns up more aggregations showing that competition doesn't increase segregations even on a pretty good spatial resolution. He reports comparable results from a more mainstream co-occurrence approach and suggests the probabilistic method may be useful for other studies. 

This is in contrast to ETE analyses where biogeographic agg/seg make up a good chunk of significant associations. This may be why he has so many more aggs but not necessarily in light of the sparrow analysis. He uses temporal data but only averages over time instead of looking at change over time. May be useful to acquire this dataset and use it as a temporal network thing. He fails to check if clusters are formed despite the very dynamic nature of most individual links. This would be something I'd want to investigate with this data.},

Abstract We evaluated the overlap of diets between birds and bats in natural forest fragments of the Beni Biological Station (Bolivia). We applied the community coefficient (CC) and the community similarity coefficient (PS) to the different species of seeds found in fecal samples. Diet overlapping between birds and bats in the studied forest fragments showed low values in all used indexes (CC = 0,15 and PS = 0,09). However, the overlapping indexes between several species of bats and birds are very high. At the variation of the community structure of birds and bats in April and July, we found that the major part of the species exists at a high seasonal variation in their presence and abundance, constantly dominating the frugivorous species.

@article{Heleno2011,
abstract = {Recently, the focus of conservation efforts gradually changed from a species-centred approach to a broader ambition of conserving functional ecosystems. This new approach relies on the understanding that much ecosystem function is a result of the interaction of species to form complex interaction networks. Therefore measures summarising holistic attributes of such ecological networks have the potential to provide useful indicators to guide and assess conservation objectives. The most generally accepted insight is that complexity in species interactions, measured by network connectance, is an important attribute of healthy communities which usually protects them from secondary extinctions. An implicit and overlooked corollary to this generalization is that conservation efforts should be directed to conserve highly connected communities. We conducted a literature review to search for empirical evidence of a relationship between connectance (complexity) and conservation value (communities on different stages of degradation). Our results show that the often assumed positive relationship between highly connected and desirable (i.e. with high conservation value) communities does not derive from empirical data and that the topic deserves further discussion. Given the conflicting empirical evidence revealed in this study, it is clear that connectance on its own cannot provide clear information about conservation value. In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, studies of species interaction networks should incorporate the different 'conservation value' of nodes (i.e. species) in a network if it is to be of practical use in guiding and evaluating conservation practice.},

abstract = {Ecosystem conservation is important for biodiversity and for human well-being. Understanding the relative risks to ecosystems is fundamental to well-informed ecosystem management. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems protocol provides an adaptable framework for risk assessment across terrestrial, subterranean, freshwater and marine ecosystems. I review a series of detailed case studies, published in this special edition of Austral Ecology, that apply the Red List of Ecosystems criteria to a broad range of ecosystem types. These studies show that detailed risk assessments are especially valuable as forerunners to strategic ecosystem management. Key components of Red List assessments that contribute to development of management strategies include critical diagnosis of trends and their causes, identification of dependencies that influence ecosystem responses to environmental change and selection of ecosystem-specific diagnostic variables that can be useful monitoring tools for evaluating the performance of management. Ecosystem Red List assessments are crucial to regulatory processes under environmental legislation in Australia and other countries. The IUCN Red List of Ecosystem criteria will help improve the scientific rigour of statutory listings and could also provide a unifying framework for the suite of listing processes that differ among jurisdictions for historical reasons. When integrated with a comprehensive ecosystem typology, ecosystem Red List assessments can also provide critical input into systematic conservation planning. The case studies demonstrate a range of analytical approaches to risk assessment framed to accommodate data of varying quality and abundance. I conclude by exploring opportunities and requirements for a systematic continental-scale Red List assessment of Australian ecosystems.},

abstract = {Although numerous studies show that communities are jointly influenced by predation and competitive interactions, few have resolved how temporal variability in these interactions influences community assembly and stability. Here, we addressed this challenge in experimental microbial microcosms by employing empirical dynamic modelling tools to: (1) detect causal interactions between prey species in the absence and presence of a predator; (2) quantify the time-varying strength of these interactions and (3) explore stability in the resulting communities. Our findings show that predators boost the number of causal interactions among community members, and lead to reduced dynamic stability, but higher coexistence among prey species. These results correspond to time-varying changes in species interactions, including emergence of morphological characteristics that appeared to reduce predation, and indirectly facilitate growth of predator-susceptible species. Jointly, our findings suggest that careful consideration of both context and time may be necessary to predict and explain outcomes in multi-trophic systems.},

abstract = {Coexistence between plant species is well known to depend on the outcomes of species interactions within an environmental context. The incorporation of environmental variation into empirical studies of coexistence are rare, however, due to the complex experiments needed to do so and the lack of feasible modelling approaches for determining how environmental factors alter specific coexistence mechanisms. In this article, we present a simple modelling framework for assessing how variation in species interactions across environmental gradients impact on niche overlap and fitness differences, two core determinants of coexistence. We use a novel formulation of an annual plant population dynamics model that allows for competitive and facilitative species interactions and for variation in the strength and direction of these interactions across environmental gradients. Using this framework, we examine outcomes of plant–plant interactions between four commonly co-occurring annual plant species from Western Australian woodlands. We then determine how niche overlap and fitness differences between these species vary across three environmental gradients previously identified as important for structuring diversity patterns in this system: soil phosphorus, shade and water. We found facilitation to be a widespread phenomenon and that interactions between most species pairs shift between competitive and facilitative across multiple environmental gradients. Environmental conditions also altered the strength, direction and relative variation of both niche overlap and fitness differences in nonlinear and unpredictable ways. Synthesis. We provide a simple framework for incorporating environmental heterogeneity into explorations of coexistence mechanisms. Our findings highlight the importance of the environment in determining the outcome of species interactions and the potential for pairwise coexistence between species. The prevalence of facilitation in our system indicates a need to improve current theoretical frameworks of coexistence to include noncompetitive interactions and ways of translating these effects into explicit predictions of coexistence. Our study also suggests a need for further research into determining which factors result in consistent responses of niche overlap and fitness differences to environmental variation. Such information will improve our ability to predict outcomes of coexistence, invasion events and responses of whole communities to future environmental change.},

abstract = {Ecological networks have a long history in ecology, and a recent increase in network analyses across environmental gradients has revealed important changes in their structure, dynamics, and functioning. These changes can be broadly grouped according to three nonexclusive mechanisms: (a) changes in the species composition of the networks (driven by interaction patterns of invaders, nonrandom extinction of species according to their traits, or differences among species in population responses across gradients); (b) changes that alter interaction frequencies via changes in search efficiency (driven by altered habitat structure or metabolic rates) or changes in spatial and temporal overlap; and (c) changes to coevolutionary processes and patterns. Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to environmental change. Emerging evidence links network structure to ecosystem functioning; however, scaling up to metanetworks or multilayer networks may modify interpretations of network structure, stability, and functioning.},
